Accreditation (taught programmes),"A number?of our programmes have external accreditation.
Schools are required to declare which of their programmes are accredited by professional, statutory and regulatory bodies (PSRBs), what the accreditation or inspection arrangements are and inform the QA Team of amendments. The QA Team maintain an accurate database of all accreditations?across the institution.
Schools are required to provide the reports and any action plans arising from accreditation visits to enable the QA Functional lead?to upload the documents to a central repository.?Reports from the PSRBs are considered through academic review processes.
The QA Team review accreditation reports and produce an annual report to the Taught Student Education Board (TSEB) outlining the institutional status of PSRB and accreditations, and highlighting any issues of institutional significance.
More details can be found in the?Policy on?PSRBs and?Accreditation.

Attendance code of practice (taught students),"Students are expected to attend all timetabled sessions. The University is clear about its expectations of students and in the information that schools provide to students to enable them to attend regularly.
University code of practice
The sessions organised as part of a programme of study - lectures, group work, laboratory work, tutorials, seminars and practical classes - are a crucial part of enabling students to achieve the maximum benefit from their time at the University.

Attendance at designated online and remote sessions is compulsory irrespective of whether or not a module forms a core, optional or elective part of a programme of study.
Schools will have procedures for students to report absence / monitor engagement?and make clear the procedures for students to apply for leave of absence in exceptional circumstances.
Schools will have a clear process for monitoring?student engagement?and addressing any patterns of non-attendance or low attendance?at an early stage. Where non-attendance is a potential problem a ""warning system"" will be in place for the student. If the problem continues the Unsatisfactory Work, Attendance and Engagement Procedure will be used.
Co-curricular activities and paid employment must normally be fitted around formal timetable commitments. Wednesday afternoons, that is from 1.00pm, will normally be kept free for co-curricular activities. On occasions where a student is involved in a University supported activity, eg competing in a national sporting event or representing the University in a sporting event, which involves leaving a timetabled session before 1.00pm they must notify the tutor in advance in order to discuss how the session commitments might be met in another way. It is the responsibility of the student to find out what work has been missed and to complete any tasks set.
Schools will indicate normal teaching hours making special arrangements to meet the needs of students undertaking religious observance.
Schools will make clear the preparation students are expected to undertake before each timetabled session and whether supporting material is needed for use in class.
Sessions will start promptly at five minutes past the hour and end promptly at five minutes to the hour, unless otherwise agreed with students for a particular session/module.?
Timetabled sessions will only be cancelled in exceptional and unavoidable circumstances, eg staff illness, and alternative arrangements made to minimise disruption for students.?
Staff will all be made aware of the school policy on non-engagement to prevent variability in the treatment of students.
The school policy on?engagement will be considered annually by the Student:Staff committee.
The Dean of Faculty is responsible for ensuring compliance by schools with this code of practice.

Programme title changes (taught students),"Titles of programmes on which students have already been accepted or are currently registered can only be changed if this is unavoidable. A change in programme title affects the validity of student visas for students outside the EEA.
The?Policy on programme title changes (PDF)?was updated in 2010-11 to reflect obligations under the introduction of the Points Based System of immigration control.
 "
Religious observance,"Our institutional timetable is set to accommodate religious observance where possible. Sometimes issues feel or become more complex at an individual school or service level.
What students need to do?
Students who, for religious reasons, are unable to carry out their university work on a Sabbath or a holy day must advise their school(s) immediately. ?
Where a student's religious commitments prevent them from taking exams on certain days during University assessment periods, they must also?give notice to the Assessment & Progress Team by completing?the?Notification of religious commitments form?by?the last Friday in October for January assessments and by the end of Week 4 of teaching in semester 2 for May/June assessments (see the timeline).
Where exemption is approved, it is the student¡¯s responsibility to ensure they have covered all work from classes that they have missed.
The University will make every effort to avoid arranging assessments on a Sabbath or holy day for those students who have informed the Assessment & Progress Team as required. The University, however, reserves the right to hold assessments?on such days if no alternative time is convenient.?
Further guidance
The Equality Policy Unit provides guidance for staff and students on flexibility on grounds of religion or belief?(PDF) to enable staff to respond in a way which is non-discriminatory. The document offers practical suggestions for handling such requests.

Risk assessment of fieldwork,"Fieldwork is an essential part of University teaching and research, enabling and inspiring many staff and students¡¯ academic and personal development.
Fieldwork includes any activity carried out for the purpose of research outside of the university. This could include archaeological digs, environmental surveys, or interviews. Fieldwork does not include placements but does include meetings and conferences in the UK and abroad.
People organising fieldwork need to use an effective fieldwork assessment process to minimise risk and ensure that as a University we fulfil our duty of care to protect staff, students and other affected people. 
Health and Safety Services set out what?the University requires of staff and students?in respect of fieldwork health and safety considerations along with guidance to help achieve this.

Supernumerary modules,"Supernumerary modules are modules chosen by students for interest only and are taken as extra credits on top of the normal amount of credits for the year of study?(usually 120 credits?for an?undergraduate Programme Year or 180 for a postgraduate Programme Year).
Students are permitted to register for up to 20 credits of supernumerary modules each year (at the discretion of the parent school) and schools must inform the Exams and Progress Team of the choice at the beginning of the session and before the deadline for changing modules (see Timeline of Events for deadlines).?
Credits gained in supernumerary modules cannot be counted for progression?or classification purposes (e.g. a student passing 70 credits plus a 10-credit supernumerary module is not permitted to include the supernumerary credits to give them the 80 credits required to progress).
Where any supernumerary modules?are required to meet the learning outcomes of a specific programme, the rule as to whether these credits count for classification should be stated in the Programme Specification and made clear in corresponding material for students. Where students opt to take supernumerary modules outside of the Programme Specification these do not count towards classification.
Supernumerary modules will be recorded on Banner with a status of SN and marks gained for such modules will appear on official transcripts."
Timetabling and central space management,"The policy sets out the University's approach to constructing the teaching timetable, booking rooms and teaching space facilities and support.
The Timetabling and central space management policy (PDF) sets out who is responsible for which aspects of producing the teaching timetable, the order of priority when booking rooms and gives practical advice, for example, explaining what happens when a room booking has to be changed."
Timetabling Policies and Guidance Documents,"This section contains published University Timetabling policies and timelines. It also contains useful guidance documents for other?systems that are linked to the timetabling system.
Rearranging scheduled teaching
Teaching should only be rearranged where unavoidable. Taught Student Education Board has outlined how changes should be made and communicated to students.
If teaching does have to be cancelled and rearranged, the?Policy on rearranging scheduled teaching (PDF) outlines the correct way to do this and how any new arrangements should be communicated to students.

Registration,"Registration is an annual?process for all students, and it is the School's responsibility to support the students with the process. This page lists downloadable resources for staff to use.?
This webpage was updated on 1st?September?2021?and is correct at the time of writing for students who are starting programmes in September 2021.?Please check this page regularly for updates,?as new information will be added when?it becomes available.??
All students must complete the online registration steps to ""register"" for each academic year. New students (those entering a new course via admissions)?also usually need to have their?identity checked in order to fully register*.?Registration is a separate process to module enrolment; students do not need to be registered to complete module enrolment.?
Identity checks for 2021-22
This year, the Identity Check takes place online. Rather than visiting the Great Hall and showing their documents, students submit their documents through an MS Form. Staff process those documents and update Banner accordingly. The form can be accessed through the link on students.leeds.ac.uk/registration?(identity check page).?As well as the identity documents, the MS Form instructs students to upload a passport style photograph. This image is then re-sized and will be uploaded to Banner for staff use. It will also be printed onto the student card.
International students (including EU/EEA/Swiss) can only complete the identity check when they have arrived in the UK. If students will not be arriving for the start of teaching i.e. studying remotely, they should?request?late arrival permission from their School?via the Late Arrival Request?form, which is available to students from the New Students webpage.

If late arrival is approved,?the student¡¯s campus flag in?the?SGASADD?More Information section?will be updated to ¡®Off Campus ¨C Approved¡¯?with?the?approved expected arrival date.?If a student has submitted several requests that have been approved, the most recent approved request will be taken.?This is an upload process that is being managed within the?Programmes & Assessment?(Operations)?team on a weekly basis, it is not automatic.
If rejected, the?School?are asked to email the student to explain the reason for the rejected late arrival request, and if appropriate, ask the student submit a different late arrival request.?No changes will be made to student¡¯s campus status if a request is rejected.??

Late expected arrival dates uploaded to?Banner allows a?student¡¯s identity check deadline to be delayed beyond the standard registration deadline (for their start month), to?30 days beyond their expected arrival date.
After completing the online identity check?form
UK & Ireland students: the student will receive an email asking them to book an appointment via EventBrite?to collect their student card at the relevant location.
International (including EU/EEA/Swiss): the student will receive a holding email. This will explain that the University is awaiting delivery of their BRP/sharecode for immigration permission (if not provided within the orignial submission). They will receive a second email asking them to book an appointment via EventBrite?to collect their student card and BRP (if applicable) at the relevant location after their immigration permission has been processed.
All of the emails are sent from no_reply_id_check@leeds.ac.uk. The emails will also include signposting information.
Student?card collection is not a mandatory step of registration.?
Further information is available from?students.leeds.ac.uk/registration.

Please note,?external students (ie they are resitting assessment(s) externally)?do not register online - you can download more information about external student status and access?here.?
*There is a small list of courses which are exempt from the requirement of identity checks; a full list of exempted programmes can be found within the ARGOS report for ""RE students with no ID Checks"". If a student on one of these courses has a UK government student loan they will regardless still need to complete the identity check so that the Funding team can confirm their registration to the Student Loans Company.

Module Enrolment,"It is the responsibility of the parent school to ensure that students enrol for their modules online and that all module and programme data is up to date and accurate.
Most students enrol upon any optional and discovery modules that will make up their programme of study?via?the module enrolment?webpages, which are?held within?Student Services. While it's open, students can use the system whenever they wish and revise their choices where necessary. The web pages incorporate?direct links to module and personal timetables, the module and programme catalogues and a filtration system for the enrolment on foreign language modules.
If students need guidance at any stage of their enrolment, they are encouraged to contact their parent school or relevant teaching school(s).
If a student wants to change their choice of module after the?module enrolment?system has closed, they must submit their request for approval by completing the?Change of Module?online form. The student¡¯s request will then be received and reviewed by their parent school. The University allows students to change modules for up to four weeks after teaching starts, however, some schools only allow changes for a shorter period.?
Study abroad and exchange students cannot use the module enrolment system to apply for modules or make changes to their programme of study. Their module enrolment is managed by the Study Abroad Office and Study Abroad coordinators within each academic school or department. For further information on this process, students should visit the Exchange and Study Abroad webpages.
School responsibilities relating to module enrolment
Updating module and programme information
Before the online system is opened to students, it is important that the relevant curricular data in both Banner and Module and Programme Catalogues is up to date, accurate and identical. Curriculum?data?held within the catalogues feeds directly into the online enrolment system, meaning errors can affect student¡¯s enrolment experience and?prevent them from selecting their choices.
Online enrolment communication and?pre-enrolment checks
The second stage of the online enrolment process is to inform students how and when to access the online enrolment system. Central Services will co-ordinate generic communications to be sent out to all students, however it is the school¡¯s responsibility to provide any school-specific targeted enrolment information to students.
There are also certain data checks that schools can make to ensure that the correct compulsory module data is on a student's record before the system is accessible to the student.
Monitoring and approving student choices
The third stage of the enrolment process is monitoring that students have enrolled online and approving their module choices. It is the parent school's responsibility to check their students complete their module enrolment and that they comply with the rules for their programme of study.
Further information
More detailed information can be found in the Module Enrolment guide for staff?together with further guidance to help schools prepare for the module enrolment exercise.
"
Attendance and engagement,"Monitoring?engagement is recognised as an important element in supporting both student retention and performance.
Regular and appropriate attendance and engagement is a University requirement, as stipulated in the Curricular Ordinances and Regulations. Many schools have effective methods in place for monitoring unauthorised absence and all schools are supported in monitoring students'?engagement in an auditable way.
Taught students
The Programme Support Functional Management Team has developed a new template Standard Operating Procedure for Attendance Monitoring (SOPAM) for the 2020-21 session. Detailed guidance information for staff (including engagement monitoring background, reporting, pathways, and escalation points for no and low engagement) can be accessed via this new template. Note: The template will be shared at Faculty-level by your local Programme Support Functional Manager in the first instance. For taught students, failure to attend and/or absence without permission can result in serious consequences for the student through the Unsatisfactory Work, Attendance and Engagement Procedure (UWAEP). Further guidance for staff (including templates and forms) can be accessed through the Student Cases Team (SCT) OneDrive.
Register Guidance for Academic/Teaching Staff
Online Teaching Sessions
Academic staff are not required to take attendance for their on-line teaching sessions for the purposes of attendance/engagement monitoring, but they may want to access the data to analyse student behaviour on their specific modules. Teaching staff can access guidance on how to take an online class register for their online teaching, by visiting the Digital Practice Virtual Classrooms webpage.
Face-to-Face Teaching Sessions
It is important that teaching staff take an electronic register of their face-to-face on-campus teaching sessions, as this information will be used for the following: Track and Trace purposes.
For Engagement Monitoring of students who attend hybrid online and face-to-face teaching. SES teams will access this information as part of the weekly reporting they will be using for student interventions.
For guidance on inputting a register into Faculty Services for a small face-to-face teaching session on-campus where a verbal roll call is required, please?use the ¡®How-to Input a F2F Register into Faculty Services - Quick Guide¡¯.
For larger teaching sessions where a verbal roll call is not feasible, we recommend you utilise Top Hat software for you to obtain an electronic attendance register (guidance is available on the Digital Practice webpage, Minerva support pages and in the IT Knowledge Base). For further guidance, please speak to your Faculty Digital Education Academic Lead or Programme Support Functional Manager.
International students
The University responds to the requirements of the Home Office's points-based system, which means it is required to report international students who fail to fully register when expected or are absent for a prolonged period without authorisation.
Research students (Doctoral College)
The attendance of all research students should be monitored at certain agreed stages in the research degree candidature, with absences being recorded. The monitored attendance sessions should include all formal (in-person or remote) supervisory meetings as well as other appropriate events. More information is available the PGR Progress and Monitoring webpage.
More information
For more detail about any area of student attendance / engagement, please consult the relevant policies above.

Attendance code of practice (taught students),"Students are expected to attend all timetabled sessions. The University is clear about its expectations of students and in the information that schools provide to students to enable them to attend regularly.
University code of practice
The sessions organised as part of a programme of study - lectures, group work, laboratory work, tutorials, seminars and practical classes - are a crucial part of enabling students to achieve the maximum benefit from their time at the University.

Attendance at designated online and remote sessions is compulsory irrespective of whether or not a module forms a core, optional or elective part of a programme of study.
Schools will have procedures for students to report absence / monitor engagement?and make clear the procedures for students to apply for leave of absence in exceptional circumstances.
Schools will have a clear process for monitoring?student engagement?and addressing any patterns of non-attendance or low attendance?at an early stage. Where non-attendance is a potential problem a ""warning system"" will be in place for the student. If the problem continues the Unsatisfactory Work, Attendance and Engagement Procedure will be used.
Co-curricular activities and paid employment must normally be fitted around formal timetable commitments. Wednesday afternoons, that is from 1.00pm, will normally be kept free for co-curricular activities. On occasions where a student is involved in a University supported activity, eg competing in a national sporting event or representing the University in a sporting event, which involves leaving a timetabled session before 1.00pm they must notify the tutor in advance in order to discuss how the session commitments might be met in another way. It is the responsibility of the student to find out what work has been missed and to complete any tasks set.
Schools will indicate normal teaching hours making special arrangements to meet the needs of students undertaking religious observance.
Schools will make clear the preparation students are expected to undertake before each timetabled session and whether supporting material is needed for use in class.
Sessions will start promptly at five minutes past the hour and end promptly at five minutes to the hour, unless otherwise agreed with students for a particular session/module.?
Timetabled sessions will only be cancelled in exceptional and unavoidable circumstances, eg staff illness, and alternative arrangements made to minimise disruption for students.?
Staff will all be made aware of the school policy on non-engagement to prevent variability in the treatment of students.
The school policy on?engagement will be considered annually by the Student:Staff committee.
The Dean of Faculty is responsible for ensuring compliance by schools with this code of practice.

Self-funded students?must make?full payment or?pay 50% and set up an?instalment plan arranging payment of the remaining balance. Overseas students are no longer?required to set up a UK bank account as part of this process. Students can?still provide UK bank account details?when they have them, otherwise they must make manual payment for their second instalment by the due date.
Home/EU students
Undergraduates need to have a Student Support Number (SSN) showing (proving they have applied for a loan at some point) to register. If they do not have this they will be asked to make full payment, to?complete an instalment plan or have a provide a sponsor letter.
Taught Postgraduates students who are self-funded?must make an initial payment of 50% of their fee and to?set up an instalment plan?arranging second payment in February by Direct Debit from a UK bank account or a confirmed sponsor letter. Students with a PG student?loan (PGL) can pay in?three instalments, payable in line with their loan payment dates, no up-front payment required. PGL students will be withdrawn if their first payment defaults and is not brought up to date.
Research Postgraduates students who are self-funded?must make an initial payment of 50% of their fee and to?set up an instalment plan?arranging second payment 5 months after their start date by Direct Debit from a UK bank account or a confirmed sponsor letter.?Overtime (writing up) fees must be paid in full and cannot be split into instalments."
Change of module,"Students can submit a request to change modules after the module enrolment system closes by using an online form.?
The University allows students to change modules for up to four weeks after teaching starts. However, some schools only allow changes for a shorter period so be careful when advising students about enrolment. Change of module deadlines are from the second week of teaching but vary by school. Some teaching schools require consultation when a student wishes to enrol on or drop one of their modules.?Please refer to this list of school requirements, deadlines and contact details.?
Once online module enrolment has closed - dates are given in the enrolment guide - students will need to access the online change of module form from the For Students website.
Full details of the new process are detailed in the Operational Guidance.
The Change of Module form closes at the end of week 4 of teaching in the relevant semester.
If a student wishes to change modules after the week 4?deadline has passed, the proposed change must have approval from the Head of School before the change will be allowed.? Confirmation of approval must then be forwarded to the Assessment & Progress Team.? Late module changes after week 4 of teaching are subject to a ¡ê50 late fee.
With Head of School approval students can change modules?up until the end of week 8 of teaching.? After week 8 students are not permitted to change modules and are?expected to complete the assessment for any modules they are enrolled on, and are considered to have missed too much teaching to enrol on any new modules that are taught in that semester.?
After week 8 of teaching and?with permission from the school?students can replace modules, either taking a new module in the next semester or the next academic year.? The module they are replacing will remain on the record and the mark achieved will be recorded on the transcript.? The replaced module will be considered the second and final attempt at the module and will be for a capped module mark.? Where a student is permitted to replace a module confirmation of approval must?be sent to the Assessment & Progress Team.?
"
Change of programme ,"Students do not have an automatic entitlement to change programme, but if places are available and the student meets entry criteria they may be permitted to move to a new programme.
A student enquiring about a potential change of programme will be required to complete this Change of Programme Initial Enquiry Form in the first instance. ?The proposed new Parent School will receive an email notification of the enquiry, which they will consider according to local criteria.
If the student is a Tier 4 international student AND the change would result in a change of programme duration, the Tier 4 Team (pbs@leeds.ac.uk) must be consulted before the change is approved.? It is essential that immigration restrictions are checked and that the student receives immigration advice before a change of programme is approved.? If approved, this will then enable students to request their new CAS and make their new Tier 4 application without delay.?
Tier 4 international students who will be undertaking a work placement or study abroad year can apply for their new Tier 4 leave (visa) before or after their work placement/year abroad as long as this is done before their current leave expires. For further information regarding the process, please see our work placements and study abroad visa page.
Once a change of programme request is approved, the proposed new Parent School will ask the student to complete a full Change of Programme Formal Submission Form and will update the student record in Banner on receipt of the completed form.
Full details of the new process are detailed in the Operational Guidance.
For more information about students changing programme, contact your local Programme Support Manager.?
?
"
Extensions to study period (taught postgraduate),"A standard procedure is in place for taught postgraduate students to be given extra time to complete their degree programme. This will also extend their library and IT access.
Full time taught postgraduate students are normally registered with the University for one academic session and their student record is in a single ""term"" in Banner. The maximum registration period allowed by the University is the standard duration of the programme plus two years ""top up"".?
If students need additional time to complete their programme and schools are happy to support the request, following the process below will ensure the student record is updated as appropriate.
What schools need to do
Extensions of less than four weeks
Inform the Programmes and Assessment (Operations) team via email with the new expected completion date. Operations will then update the record accordingly, no form required.
Extensions within the maximum time period
Complete an extension request form and submit it to Programmes and Assessment (Operations), ideally at least two months before the end of the student's current completion date.
A separate extension form is required for each student and each new extension (unless the new extension is for less than four weeks).? Extensions can be granted for a maximum of one academic year at a time.
Operations will then inform the relevant teams, including the Library, of the student's new expected completion date once an extension has been approved and processed. The school contact will receive an email confirming if the extension is granted at the same time.?
The record will remain in the current Banner ""term"" and only the end date will be amended if the new expected completion date is no later than the next month end i.e the term record of an October starter can be extended until the end of November.
For extensions of a greater duration that the above, Programmes and Assessment (Operations) will create a new term record for which the student will need to register for.
Extensions beyond the maximum time limit?
Once the two year ""top up"" period has elapsed, extensions can only be granted by the Student Cases team in the Secretariat.
Fees
An extension fee is applicable but it is at the School's discretion whether the fee should be charged or waived.

?
Scenarios where an extension request form is not required
The following scenarios entail the student being registered for longer than the initial study period but are not classed as extensions.
Students on ""top up"" degrees
Some programmes of study allow students to start on a PGCert or PGDip qualification and ""top up"" to a Masters degree. There are two ways in which the student record can be managed.
Continuous study
If the student is progressing from the PGCert or PGDip to the Masters programme without a gap, update Banner by using the change of programme process. Then contact Programmes and Assessment (Operations) and ask them to review and update the record as necessary in order for the student to be able to register if required.
Non-continuous study
If the School has made the award then then the student will need to reapply to the University with ""advance standing"".
?
Repeating or resitting or granted first attempts
?
Banner is updated following submission of results after exam boards via Operations being notified by the Examination team.
?
"
Supernumerary modules,"Supernumerary modules are modules chosen by students for interest only and are taken as extra credits on top of the normal amount of credits for the year of study?(usually 120 credits?for an?undergraduate Programme Year or 180 for a postgraduate Programme Year).
Students are permitted to register for up to 20 credits of supernumerary modules each year (at the discretion of the parent school) and schools must inform the Exams and Progress Team of the choice at the beginning of the session and before the deadline for changing modules (see Timeline of Events for deadlines).?
Credits gained in supernumerary modules cannot be counted for progression?or classification purposes (e.g. a student passing 70 credits plus a 10-credit supernumerary module is not permitted to include the supernumerary credits to give them the 80 credits required to progress).
Where any supernumerary modules?are required to meet the learning outcomes of a specific programme, the rule as to whether these credits count for classification should be stated in the Programme Specification and made clear in corresponding material for students. Where students opt to take supernumerary modules outside of the Programme Specification these do not count towards classification.
Supernumerary modules will be recorded on Banner with a status of SN and marks gained for such modules will appear on official transcripts."

If you can¡¯t find the answer to your question, please contact your School Timetabler for further guidance, you can find contact details here.
How do I find?my staff online timetable?
By logging into MyTimetable. Instructions for how to do this can be found here.
Why are the teaching term weeks numbered the way they are?
Several schools teach throughout the year, not just during the standard term time so we need a timetable that runs for 52 weeks. The teaching term week pattern allows us to timetable and easily reference weeks outside of the standard term in a way that works with the restrictions of the timetabling software.
Where can I find the teaching term week pattern calendar?
You can download the teaching week pattern?calendar from here. The University also has a printable year planner which shows the University close days to help with your planning.
What does all the information on my timetable mean?
If you look at your timetable in MyTimetable mobile view (default),?you will a list of your upcoming teaching. Each activity that appears on the list will include:

Time and day?¨C?the start and finish time of the activity
Module Code?
Activity name,?(e.g.?ARAB311001/LEC 1/01 <7-12, 14-17>?which is made up of:
	
Module Code? (or codes for Jointly Taught activities)
The activity type (e.g. lecture (LEC), tutorial (TUT))
The group number?for this particular activity
Content in the < > is for timetablers use


Location?¨C?details of the location will be shown for on-campus teaching. Clicking on the location name will take you to a page that provides directions to the rooms, along with other useful information (when you have on-campus face-to-face teaching, please avoid congregating outside rooms once your teaching has finished).
Teaching weeks?¨C?the week(s) the activity is taught in (located on the right side for the ¡®mobile¡¯ view and on the left side for the ¡®desktop¡¯ view)

When you select each activity, you will see the following additional information:

Activity Type*?¨C e.g. Lecture, Tutorial
Module Description
Staff Name?¨C?this is academic member of staff who is delivering the teaching activity to you.
[Optional] Note ¨C?e.g. topics, guest speaker names, locations that are not included in the timetabling software
Recording Status ¨C?Recording, Recording (Audio and Screen only) or Not Recording. Please note that this only relates the on-campus lecture capture systems in the room.

Where can I find directions to the room my teaching is taking place in?
You can find room information and directions to every Central Teaching Space room on campus here. If you are teaching in a school owned room and unsure of what equipment the room has or how to find it, please contact your School Timetabler.
I have a problem with the equipment in a room I¡¯ve booked, who should I contact?
Equipment and room faults should be reported to the Estates Helpdesk on 0113 343 5555 (ext. 35555), further information can be found here.
How do I make an ad-hoc lecture recording in an on-campus room?
Guidance on how to use Record Now (formerly Ad-hoc Recorder) can be found in the IT knowledge base.
Why is my timetable blank?

If you are a new member of staff or an existing member of staff whose HR ID number has changed this can prevent your timetable from appearing. In this case, contact your School Timetabler, remembering to provide your HR ID number and username so that they can check the correct number is entered into the?timetable system.
You may not have been attached to any teaching yet, contact your School Timetabler if you are expecting to see teaching.

Why is my timetable incomplete?

You may not have been attached to all your teaching yet, contact your School Timetabler to ensure they are aware that you have teaching outstanding.
Your School Timetabler may not have been notified you are teaching, please contact them so that they can arrange for your timetable to be updated.

How quickly can I see changes made to my timetable?
Once your School Timetabler has indicated the change has been made it usually takes around 15 minutes for the online timetable to reflect the change. It can occasionally take longer ¨C?if a change is still not visible after 24 hours please report this to your School Timetabler.
Can I sync my online staff timetable to my outlook calendar?
Yes, you can find instructions on how to do this on the help section on MyTimetable, under the section ¡®Connecting calendar options¡¯.
Where can I see a module?or programme timetable?
You can find module and programme timetables here.
I have accessibility needs and am teaching on-campus, what do I need to do?
Contact your School Timetabler. You do not need to provide any specific details other than what kind of room would be suitable, e.g. wheelchair access, level access, assistive listening system. It would be helpful if you could contact your timetabler as soon as you know what?teaching you would like to take place on-campus so that the request for a suitable room can be made.
When do classes start and finish?
Classes are usually timetabled between 9am and 6pm, Monday to Friday, except for Wednesdays afternoons after 1pm; where possible, teaching for UG students is avoided after 1pm. Sometimes classes fall outside of these times ¨C where specialist facilities are required?or due to the nature of the teaching. Lessons should ideally start at 5 past and finish at 5 to the hour to allow staff and students time to move out of the room and to their next class.
How do I book a room for an activity that isn¡¯t teaching?
You can request rooms using the web room booking system. Do not use the room booking system to book teaching activities as they won't appear on your students' timetables. This includes teaching outside core hours.
I need to reschedule my teaching due to an unforseen event, what should I do?
Contact your School Timetabler, providing?the name of the activity as it appears on your timetable and when you would like to reschedule it to so they can look at alternatives. If you need to cancel your teaching at short-notice, please remember to email your students.
A student has contacted me to ask if they can change groups, is this possible?
Contact your School Timetabler for guidance. Groups sizes are carefully monitored, the School Timetablers should be kept informed of any changes so they can make sure groups are accurate in the timetabling system.
My groups of students are not the same as my attendance monitoring class lists, what do I need to do?
Contact your School Timetabler for guidance. The attendance monitoring system takes information directly from the timetabing system, so should be correct as long as the group information held in timetabling system is also correct. If you have students in your class that are not listed, they may be attending your group in error. The Timetabler may contact them to advise them of their correct group or re-allocate them to your group.

Guidance for Teaching Staff: The Timetable and Delivery Methods,"When?thinking about the timetable and delivery methods you wish to adopt for your teaching here are some key points to keep in mind.
The University timetable informs students and staff of the teaching activities associated with their modules.?
On-Campus Teaching
If you want to teach on-campus you will need to let your School timetabler know you need a room, and any particular room requirements you have, e.g. IT cluster, flat floored room, whiteboard, projector, level access etc. The room details will then be visible to the students so they understand what they need to do to access their learning (attend on-campus).
For 2022/23 Teaching?¨C?timetables for 2022/23 teaching will show the location information in line with standard University deadlines for the production of the 2022/23 timetable (draft locations visible by mid-August 2022). Draft timetables without a location will be visible from the 2nd?of May 2022.
?
Online Teaching
Live online teaching
If you intend to teach live online, you and your module team will need to ensure you guide students carefully on how they access the online learning shown on their University timetables, for example, you might post Minerva annoucements with links to their online virtual classroom session. You will need to let your School timetabler know the activity is taking place online so that they can indicate the delivery method is Online Live ¨C?See Minerva.?It may possible for timetablers to add links to online teaching to the student¡¯s personal timetable (please discuss this with your timetabler as this is not always possible).
Please keep in mind timetablers can only timetable in 30 minute increments.?Let¡¯s consider a particular scenario: if you want a 15 minute online live lecture followed by 35 minute online live discussion this will appear on the timetable as a 1 hour online live activity. It will not be possible for the timetabler to provide a greater level of detail on the timetable, you would need to communicate the structure to students through other methods (e.g. an announcement or outline document in Minerva). It may be possible in some cases to add a description of 5-6 words to an activity, however, this would need to be discussed with your timetabler?as this option is not always available.
Pre-recorded teaching
If you have advised your timetabler that an activity will be delivered using Pre-Recorded content you will need to ensure that your students are aware of how to access the recordings (e.g. in Minerva in a particular folder you have set up).
Unless you have asked for pre-recorded activities to appear on the timetable these will not be shown on the timetable.?If you ask for pre-recorded activitities to appear on the student¡¯s timetable these only act as a reminder that the content should be watched and will be timetabled at the start or end of the day to avoid introducing unnecessary clashes.
?
Simultaneous on-campus and online delivery
The University introduced two new room suitabilities in 2021, these offer teaching staff the opportunity to offer hybrid delivery, Live Streaming and Multi-Mode.

Live Streaming functionality is available in around 90 teaching spaces across campus. Live streaming allows one-way teaching delivery to both in-room and remote students simultaneously, and also opens up additional opportunities for conferencing and open days.
Multi-mode teaching describes the delivery of content in a teaching room to both in-room and remote students simultaneously whilst supporting full interaction between all participants. In-room and remote students are able to see and hear each other and interact through standard collaborative methods.

You¡¯ll need to let your School Timetabler know if you want a room with either Live Streaming or Multi-Mode functionality.
?
Virtual Classroom Options
The University currently offers three virtual classrooms which can be used for live online teaching: Microsoft Teams, Collaborate Ultra and Zoom. Unfortunately, at present, there is no dynamic link between any of the virtual classrooms and the University timetabling software.

Using Collaborate Ultra

If you have a module with no concurrent teaching (e.g. none of the small group teaching on your module is taught at the same time) and have less than 250 participants you can simply use the Collaborate Ultra default Course Room.?You and your students join the Course Room at the time shown on your University timetable. It is good practice to check the participant settings before your teaching starts. Guidance on how to use the Collaborate Ultra Course room.
If you have concurrent teaching?on your module and or expect more than 250 students to join?then there will be a requirement to set up sessions to facilitate this. These sessions can then be used as individual tutor rooms.The SES have provided additional guidance for using/setting up Collaborate Ultra for online teaching.
If you have any jointly taught activities with other modules, one module will need to be used to host the online activity in Collaborate whilst the students on the other modules use a guest link (set to Participant) to join as required. You can find more information on how to set this up?by reading the SES guidance on using/setting up Collaborate Ultra sessions.
You will need to ensure your online virtual classroom session is taught?at the time and date shown on the University timetable to avoid confusing your students.?

Using Teams

You can request IT to create a Class Team for your module, Class Teams inherit enrolment data from Banner so if a student changes modules these changes will appear overnight minimising the risk of them missing teaching ¨C you will not be required to manually add, remove or invite students. You can find?guidance on Class Teams and how to request one on the DE Systems Help website.
If you wish to use Teams for personal 1-2-1 tutorials you will need to ensure you schedule meetings as required and that the link is shared with your students.
You will need to ensure your online virtual classroom session is taught?at the time and date shown on the University timetable to avoid confusing your students.?

Using Zoom

If you wish to use Zoom for personal 1-2-1 tutorials you will need to ensure you schedule meetings as required and that the link is shared with your students.
You will need to ensure your online virtual classroom session is taught?at the time and date shown on the University timetable to avoid confusing your students.?

When a student wishes to leave,"This page covers processes to follow when a taught student (UG or TP) is considering taking leave from their studies.?
¡°Leaver¡± is a term used to refer to students who, in exceptional circumstances, are officially authorised to either take temporary leave from ?their studies of 4 weeks or more, or permanently leave their programme before completion. Requests for leave should be discussed between the Student and the School, and then submitted by the School to the Operations Team, as detailed below.
Baseline expectations

Students are required to attend all aspects of study expected by their programme and School.?
Students commit to a year¡¯s fees at the point of annual ?registration with the University ¨C only in exceptional circumstances will the University not require payment of full fees.
All leave requests submitted by schools are only made when the student has been given reasonable advice and signposting regarding the implications of their leave request.

Process
An Microsoft (MS) Form will capture the students initial leave request. ?

On completion an email will be sent to the School who should then arrange a meeting with the student to discuss the leave request further.?
An email will also be sent to the School who should then arrange a meeting with the student to discuss the leave request further.?

You can access the enquiry form here.
Step by step

Student contacts School in person or through the enquiry form.
Enquiry form captured in Sharepoint.
School contact the student and arrange a meeting..
Meeting held ideally between ?a Student Support Officer (SSO) (alternatively with an ?academic or personal tutor) ¨C Meeting should cover reason for leaving, implications ?(academic and fees/funding/visa), highlight alternatives with signposting to LUU/wellbeing/counselling services/mit circs).?
Automatic email following meeting to confirm student¡¯s decision. Yes or no determines if process continues.
If student decides to leave following the meeting, the School must ensure student is aware that they have not yet officially left ¨C still more process to follow.
School completes Sharepoint with leave information, workflow sends confirmation request to the student .
Student ¡®Accept¡¯ or ¡®rejects¡¯ conditions of request. ¡®Reject¡¯ goes back to School, ¡®Accept¡¯ goes through to Operations Team for processing.
Confirmation of processing sent to School and relevant teams.?
School informs student.

Alternatives to leave requests
There are other processes that run alongside temporary leave. These may be a more relevant route to pursue and include:

Mitigating circumstances process for examinations issues (within School or Student Cases.
Unsatisfactory Work, Attendance and Engagement Procedure (UWAEP)
Standard Operating Procedure for Attendance Monitoring (SOPAM), which relates to presumed leavers and UWAEP in this list.
Fit to Study procedure (TBC including ill health exclusion) (Student Cases)
Study Success meetings (within School)
Progression exercise (within School following school examination boards, reporting taught undergraduate students who have exhausted all resit examination attempts)
Referred students procedure (Student Cases)
Presumed (permanent) leavers ¨C please read the link for more details

Guidance on requested leaving date
The University¡¯s Operations team is responsible for finalising a student¡¯s leave start date, which may differ from the leave date requested by the student. This date will be entered into the student record and signifies when the student¡¯s leave request has been approved and processed. It is important that the leavers form is submitted to Operations within 10 working days of the initial meeting with the student, as Operations are unable to backdate beyond this period.?
Delays and backdating of leave can affect the following areas:

UKVI must be updated of any changes to the candidature within 10 working days. A backdated start of leave date would mean that this requirement is not met.?
Tuition fees.?
The student could receive funding they are not entitled to and be required to pay this back.?
Accommodation fees.?
The student may have continued to access facilities and resources past their start of leave date.?

Incomplete or inaccurate requests can also negatively impact the student in the ways mentioned above.?
Please do not submit standard requests with a ?leave date in the future. Leave requests such as this may be returned to be recompleted.
"
Temporary leavers,"This page looks at the specifics of requesting temporary leave for taught students.?
A DEFINITION OF TEMPORARY LEAVE?
A student is able to ¡®take time out¡¯ of their studies when they are experiencing difficult or challenging circumstances whilst studying with us. Students can either take temporary leave lasting under four weeks which is handled at School process level. If the circumstances affecting the student are more long term and will last over four weeks, the leave must be discussed via the school and approved by the Operations Team. ?
Students may want to take temporary leave for the following reasons:?

Health reasons ¨C both physical and mental health.?
Personal reasons ¨C including maternity, bereavement, changes in family circumstances.?
Change in programme within the University or intercalating as part of a medical degree.?

Reasons outside this list will require further approval from Head of School or academic colleagues before approval can be given by Operations. These can include:?

Employment during their degree?
Financial reasons affecting their study ?

GENERAL PROCESS FOR TEMPORARY LEAVE REQUESTS?
We expect three broad stages in leave requests:?

Student and School to agree the details of the request through meetings and documented conversations at School level
Submitted request documented in SharePoint and approved by the student using Microsoft Forms
Supporting return to study?

STUDENT AND SCHOOL CONVERSATIONS - TEMPORARY LEAVE?
Schools should ensure the student is aware of the implications of their leaving and the conditions they will need to fulfil to return to study, and signpost to resources as detailed below. The agreement of leave and return should be clearly documented between school and student. Further information on the below can be found for students on the Leaving Leeds Early students page and for staff members on the SES staff site guidance. This information is also reflected on the conditions of return form.?

Reason for leave - see also below section ¡°reasons for leave further details¡±?
Previous leave ¨C this has an impact on expected completion and length of leave?
Start of leave and expected return date ¨C this has an impact on current and future term assessment and expected completion date.?
Examinations and progression - consider whether mitigating circumstances might be required.?
Support while on Temporary leave ¨C Students can access LUU wellbeing, counselling services, School support officers for advice throughout their leave and should be advised to do so by the School?
Funding (links on the Leaving Leeds Early students page as above most relevant)?
Fees?
Student visas ¨C see the international students pages on the students site?
School/course requirements determined by school e.g. placement requirements?
Accommodation - this is not part of programme arrangements but does have a significant impact upon the student¡¯s personal situation. The University accommodation site outlines requirements to terminate a contract. ?

AGREEING LEAVE TO SUBMIT ¨C TEMPORARY LEAVE?
Temporary leave has more stringent regulations than permanent leave. As the student is expected to be returning to programme, they are still subject to University requirements whilst on leave and upon return.?
STANDARD GUIDELINES AFFECTING TEMPORARY LEAVE ?
LEAVE START REQUESTED

The University¡¯s Operations team is responsible for finalising a student¡¯s leave start date, which may differ from the leave date requested by the student. This date will be entered into the student record and signifies when the student¡¯s leave request has been approved and processed. It is important that the leavers form is submitted to Operations within 10 working days of the initial meeting with the student, as Operations are unable to backdate beyond this period.?
Degree Apprenticeships are an exception to standard leave date regulations. Due to the nature of the contracts covering Degree Apprenticeships, their leave start date must be the last instance of learning.?
End of Week 8 is considered the final point that students can take temporary leave without sitting end-of-semester assessments. For example, a student on a standard September start programme considering temporary leave in December would not be expected to standardly start leave until the start of the next semester in January, after exams are completed. If a student wishes to go on a period of temporary leaver between week 9 of semester 1 to the start of teaching in semester 2, the School must ensure approval is given by the Head of School or appropriate academic colleague. Schools must then seek permission from Student Cases, who will liaise with Operations if the leave is approved. The following guidance will assist you as to the process in which to follow to submit your case ¨C Student Cases Guidance, Templates and Forms
For all standard undergraduate courses, week 8 will be a set date in line with the University published academic calendar and can be seen in the Programmes and Assessment Timeline. For all other courses, this should be calculated based on the custom start of term date as shown on their Banner record.?

AUTHORISATION

School staff has emailed the form (those permitted to do so as agreed within the school¡¯s staff framework).
Student has emailed from their University email account authorising the same leave request that is submitted. Alternative evidence may be used only where the student is absolutely unable to authorise the form, e.g. emergency hospitalised student, and for professional based courses (in particular PGC-SCITT/S PGCE Secondary SCITT or ND-PSIA/CPD where correspondence verifying student information is agreed to come from the linked external party).?

EXPECTED RETURN DATE

Operations can approve leave from one month up to 12 months continuous temporary leave at a time (inclusive of any immediately preceding leave). For leave spanning more than 12 months continuous leave, this will need to be approved by Student Cases.?
Students are expected to return at the standard start of term or custom start of term for non-standard/calendar programmes as specified.
Students should not repeat any teaching already fully completed (unless Head of School or appropriate academic colleague authorises this).?
The students return date reflects their return to teaching. Any resits are advised to be after teaching has been resumed or after a period of external status.?

COMPLETION OF PROGRAMME
A student will be given a new expected completion date including how much time they have been on leave. Due to the Ordinances of the University, students are not allowed to study beyond the standard duration of the course by maximum two years. Therefore, their new expected completion date must not exceed this time limit.?
EVIDENCE
For all temporary leave, independent evidence of the reason for leave must be received and stored safely by the School in line with GDPR requirements.?
SUPPORTING RETURN FROM TEMPORARY LEAVE?
Returning from temporary leave is a return to teaching. It is not advised that students return to immediately take exams. If a School and student agree a return to external status, this should be thoroughly considered and agreed with the Assessment and Progress team, no later than the deadline for external resit applications (end of Week 4), flagging the student is currently on temporary leave. Any agreement on updating the record should then be made with Operations having authorisation from Assessment and Progress. Students are not allowed to take resit examinations within the same academic term as their leave. For example, if a student is on leave and due to return to study in September, they would not be permitted to take any resit examinations in August. The next examinations period they would be permitted to take their resits in would be January. ? ?
Any conditions of return should be tracked as agreed while the student is on leave. For example, if the student is required to meet with Disability Services, this should be checked at the agreed time. At minimum, Schools should email students (template available on request) either 1-2 months or well before module enrolment prior to the expected return date. If the leave was for health reasons, the School must receive a fit to study note, usually from the students GP. ?
Once return is confirmed with the student, Schools need to then email studentrecords@adm.leeds.ac.uk to flag the return and confirm fit to return evidence has been received if relevant.
Confirmation of return should be completed by April for September returners (to allow module enrolment), or otherwise in the month prior to return. Operations can then prepare the Banner record ready for return.
Before the student registers, check the Banner record is up to date. Contact the UG Fees or PG Fees team if there are any fee amendments to be made (see returners and reduced fees guidance), check modules are correct on the record and notify the student when they can complete registration.?
Where a student has failed to return from temporary leave by their expected return date, students are withdrawn in line with the monthly registration deadlines as above, following the month for registration as the month of return.?
?
If you have any questions or feedback about this page, please email studentrecords@adm.leeds.ac.uk.?

Permanent leavers,"This page covers the specifics of requesting permanent leave for taught students. Please read the ¡®When a student leaves¡¯?page for background information first.
A DEFINITION OF PERMANENT LEAVE
If a student wishes to permanently leave their programme (and usually also the University), the student will fill in a Leavers Enquiry form to organise a meeting with their school. Following this the school then decide if appropriate to submit a request for permanent leave through SharePoint to the Operations Team. This could follow on from temporary leave or be submitted simply as permanent leave.
STUDENT AND SCHOOL CONVERSATIONS - PERMANENT LEAVE
Schools should ensure the student is aware of the implications of their leaving, and signpost to resources as detailed below. The agreement of leave should be clearly documented between school and student. Further information on the below can be found for students on the Leaving Leeds Early students page and for staff members on the SES staff site guidance.

Reason for leave - see also below section ¡°reasons for leave further details¡±
Examinations and progression - consider whether mitigating circumstances might be required.
Funding (links on the Leaving Leeds Early students page above most relevant)
Fees
Student visas ¨C please see international students pages on the students site
School/course requirements determined by school e.g. placement requirements
Accommodation - this is not part of programme arrangements but does have a significant impact upon the student¡¯s personal situation. The University accommodation site outlines requirements to terminate a contract.

STANDARD GUIDELINES AFFECTING PERMANENT LEAVE
When submitting requests for permanent leave, the following guidelines must be followed before the request can be processed.
LEAVE START REQUESTED:
¡¤ The University¡¯s Operations team is responsible for finalising a student¡¯s leave start date, which may differ from the leave date requested by the student. This date will be entered into the student record and signifies when the student¡¯s leave request has been approved and processed. It is important that the leavers form is submitted to Operations within 10 working days of the initial meeting with the student, as Operations are unable to backdate beyond this period.
¡¤ Degree Apprenticeships are an exception to standard leave date regulations. Due to the nature of the contracts covering Degree Apprenticeships, their leave start date must be the last instance of learning. AUTHORISATION:
¡¤ School staff has emailed the form (those permitted to do so as agreed within the school¡¯s staff framework).
¡¤ Student has emailed from their University email account authorising the same leave request that is submitted. Alternative evidence may be used only where the student is absolutely unable to authorise the form, e.g. emergency hospitalised student, and for professional based courses (in particular PGC-SCITT/S PGCE Secondary SCITT or ND-PSIA/CPD where correspondence verifying student information is agreed to come from the linked external party).
Please see other pages for further resources. If you have any questions or feedback about this page, please email studentrecords@adm.leeds.ac.uk.
Permanently withdrawing within the first 14 days of study
New students permanently leaving within 14 days of the start of term, or course start date if non-standard, are permitted by contract to notify the University by email or cancellation form of their withdrawal.
When the School is informed of a withdrawal in this time frame, this should be forwarded to the Operations Team as soon as possible. If the withdrawal request comes as a completed standard leave form, the form should be processed in the usual manner. Only one submission of withdrawal is required, however this must reach Operations via studentrecords@adm.leeds.ac.uk or registration@leeds.ac.uk, with complete clear information and within requirements of the route used.
DEFERRALS
For students who are not fully registered, deferrals can be made by the student and/or school emailing registration@leeds.ac.uk confirming the student as a deferral (No Show), and also notifying your relevant admissions team to then make the update on Banner admissions screens, to create a new record for the student into the new cohort.
If schools receive notification of a deferral by an undergraduate or taught postgraduate student, the Admissions Teams need to be informed as a priority. Operations will need to be informed for record keeping reasons, should also informed for record updates for recordkeeping reasons.
"
Presumed leavers,"Unexplained absences of over four weeks should be addressed using the Unsatisfactory Work, Attendance and Engagement Procedure (UWAEP) and Standard Operating Procedures for Attendance Monitoring (SOPAM). This page covers actions that need to be taken when it becomes clear a student is no longer engaging with their programme.?
PRESUMED WITHDRAWN (ATTENDANCE)?
If a student fails to attend and the school suspects that they may have withdrawn, the School must refer to their Faculty/School SOPAM, which addresses the presumed withdrawn processes, and references contact attempts that are discussed in the UWAEP. Please contact your Faculty Programme Support Manager if you require access to your Faculty/School SOPAM.?
Schools must ensure they record at least 2 specific attempts to contact the student as well as inviting the student to a meeting, across a minimum 4-week period. This information is defined by the SOPAM. The Appendix C of the SOPAM should be used to document the relevant contact attempts and attendance issues and submitted to Operations as a request to instigate the presumed withdrawn process.
Please click here to email studentrecords@adm.leeds.ac.uk and access a template email of Appendix C. The UWAEP has letter templates to use for contacting the student.?
Following receipt of a presumed withdrawn request, Operations will produce and send a letter to the student and confirm with the School that the presumed withdrawn process has been instigated. Operations does not update the students record until 10 working days has passed, to allow students to reengage with the school. It is important that Operations are informed if a student reengages in this time so the process can be halted.?
After 10 working days, the School will receive confirmation of record updates and the student withdrawal process is finalised. If a student is in contact with the School after this period, they will need to follow Admissions process and reapply. ??
FAILURE TO REGISTER?
For information on process to follow if a student is withdrawn due to failure to register, please see the Registration guidance pages or contact studentrecords@adm.leeds.ac.uk for information on reinstatements. ?
FAILURE TO RETURN FROM TEMPORARY LEAVE
For information on process to follow if a student fails to return from temporary leave, please see ¡®Supporting Return from Temporary Leave¡¯ section within the Temporary Leavers webpage.?
If you have any questions or feedback about this page, please email studentrecords@adm.leeds.ac.uk
"
Fees for leavers,"If a student leaves part way through an academic year their fees may be reduced, adjustments are calculated based on the student's leave date in Banner. This adjustment is manual and is done after the receipt of the leavers workflow (UG, TP)?or copy of the leavers form (RP).
Student information can be found on our student page: tuition fee liability. This includes information about their statutory right to cancel their contract with the University of Leeds within 14 days of start of term or course start date.
School/Faculty staff are not expected to answer fee queries from leavers. However, students should be signposted to Student Fees as part of the process. 
If a student intending to leave has an urgent?query about their tuition fee liability we are happy to answer this by telephone 0113 343 6700 or email fees@leeds.ac.uk 
Students who wish to speak to a member of the Fees team face to face can be directed to visit Student Fees at the Student Services Counter in the Marjorie and Arnold Ziff building.?
The same calculations process for Undergraduate and Taught?Postgraduate students is followed for students who are leavers, temporary leavers and presumed withdrawn. For UG or PG temporary leavers who are going to return in semester 2 you will need to refer to our SES page on Returners and reduced fees.?
Tuition fees for Research postgraduates taking a suspension?are not automatically?recalculated. If you have a query regarding fee adjustments and suspensions please contact Student Fees 0113 343 6700 or email fees@leeds.ac.uk .
Once fees have been adjusted Student Fees will send a letter to the student at their permanent home address. 
Queries or complaints that Student Fees receive disputing the leaving date on this letter will be referred to the parent school.
Leaver's form
Research leavers should be directed to the following guidance pages?for leaving their research.
If a taught (UG or TP) student is unable to immediately complete a leavers form please check that this delay will not dramatically impact their fees charged. If?a student?confirms their intention to leave in writing (eg via email) the date of the email can be honoured if a leavers form is completed and processed within two weeks. 
For more information about the taught leavers process please refer to the Student Leavers?pages for staff.
Taught student leavers forms must be completed and?processed within two weeks of the leave date.?If they are not processed in the appropriate timeframe the leave date on the form may not be used and the student may be charged additional fees. 
If late processing is due to delays within the parent school (eg incomplete or misplaced form) we may ask for?the parent school?to?pay the additional amount charged so the student is not financially disadvantaged.

Students must be registered for one day of the term to become liable for fee payment. If students leave on day two of term?they must pay the % fee charge above.
Overseas undergraduates
International students who leave early will be charged monthly based on their start date. This is based on nine months study from the start date of their course.?
For example, if the student?left?on the first day of?the third month, they would incur charge of three ninths of the full fee.
Taught and research postgraduates (UK/EU/CI and Overseas)
All taught and research postgraduates?who leave early will be charged monthly based on their start date. This is based on 12 months study from the start date of their course.?
For example, if the student?left?on the first day of?the third month, they would incur charge of three twelfths of the full fee. 
When a research student goes on suspension their fees are not automatically recalculated. Overtime (writing up) fees are not reduced if a student takes suspension, completes?or leaves during the year.
Accommodation?
Students living in University accommodation will need to give 8 weeks' notice and submit a leaver's form, signed by the parent school, in order to be released from their accommodation contract.
More information about students who wish to leave their accommodation can be found on the Accommodation Services website"
Funding for disabled students,"The main source of funding for disabled students from the UK is the Disabled Students' Allowance. ?
?
Disabled Students' Allowances (DSA)
DSA is funding provided to disabled students to assist with disability-related costs resulting from their programme of study and allowing them to participate fully. It is not means tested and does not need to be repaid.?Students receiving equipment through their DSA are allowed to keep that equipment when their programme has ended.
Most UK students are eligible to apply. Prospective students will have their specific needs assessed and will receive a needs assessment report.
For most students, DSA is provided by the government through Student Finance England. Students on healthcare courses will need to apply through the NHS.
Postgraduate research students who are funded by one of the Research Councils can apply for DSA. Further information is available on the Research Councils UK (RCUK) website.
Applying for DSA
The way in which students apply for and are assessed for funding differs between funding sources, as does the process for invoicing and reclaiming the cost of support.
The funding application process can take three months so applicants should be encouraged to apply as soon as possible. They do not have to have a confirmed place on a programme at the University.?
DSA provided by Student Finance England
Applicants for funding should follow the up to date guidance provided on the British Government website.?
?
?
?
DSA provided by the NHS?
Applicants to healthcare programmes should apply for DSA as part of their student bursary application. Up to date guidance and an online application system are provided on the NHS Business Services Authority website.?



DSA provided by Research Councils UK (RCUK)
Students funded by a Research Council should discuss their disability-related funding with a Disability Coordinator. Claims are submitted ona a proforma via graduate schools to the Postgraduate Scholarships Office, who are responsible for submitting applications to research councils. The deadline for submission is mid-October each year. Further information is available on the?Research Councils UK (RCUK) website.
What level of funding is available through DSA?

Funding will vary according to the results of each applicant's assessment of need, up to maximum levels which are available on the government website. These are reviewed regularly.
For undergraduate students funding is divided into allowances for specialist equipment, non-medical helpers and a general allowance.
For postgraduate students who have recently had equipment funded through DSA for an undergraduate programme, this may be deemed sufficient for further study.
Other sources of funding

Disability Services will work with students to find further sources of funding for students who either are not eligible for any of the DSA schemes or whose DSA funding does not cover the support that they need.
Encourage students to contact DSAS as soon as possible.?
Students who exceed their DSA will still receive support during their studies at Leeds.

"
Tuition fee Scholarships and awards ,"University departments?may make tuition fee awards to students, for example?the alumni bursary or as part of a postgraduate research scholarship.?To do this, departments should use a FA1?form. Guidance on how to complete a form is below.
Forms
?

FA1 Form ¨C can be used to authorise and notify Student Fees of fee scholarships
Fee Amendment Form ¨C used to notify Student Fees of an amendment to an existing student fee award
Fee Reversal form ¨C used to notify Student Fees of the need to completely reverse a fee scholarship?

Guidance documentation
?

Guidance document ¨C this is a detailed overview of how to complete the forms, where to send them, and how to request an amendment to an award.

Process Overview: Notifying Student Fees?
?

Individual in the School or Service completes a FA1 form
An Authorised Signatory emails the form directly to FA1@leeds.ac.uk (not cc-ed or bcc-ed).
If all necessary information has been provided and sent by an Authorised Signatory, Student Fees will enter the award on the Banner system.??

?
Student Fees can only accept the approved version of the FA1, Payment Amendment, and Reversal forms due to specific formatting requirements (available above). Any old versions of the form cannot be processed and therefore payments will not be made. Any forms submitted by an unauthorised Signatory cannot be processed.?
Forms, What to Use and How (the Dos and Don'ts)?
Please note that the FA1 form uses macros to facilitate some of the built in functionality and?it is important that once you have finished using the FA1 form you completely close down Excel before continuing on with other work. If you do not completely close Excel?there can be issues with certain action (such as copy and pasting) that occur as a result of the Visual Basic for?Applications (VBA) programme continuing to run in the background.
We have aimed to keep complexity to a minimum however, if you have any issues inputting information on a form, please contact Student Fees and we will be happy to provide you with extra information or training.
Please check carefully that the SID and Surname has been entered correctly before sending. Note, the first name is not required for GDPR compliance.
Is the student eligible for a scholarship? The Fees team do not audit eligibility. For example, if the scholarship is only valid for alumni or self-funding students you must check this before completing the form.
Has the student been informed? Student fees do not contact students to say an award has been added to the system, you must notify the student to ensure they know about any scholarships.
Please send the completed form directly to FA1@leeds.ac.uk (not cc-ed or bcc-ed).
Please do:
?

Check that the Cost Object Number quoted is in a valid format
Check that the Student ID number(s) quoted match the student listed
Only use one cost object/account number per FA1 form. This will greatly help the student fees team when inputting and reduce input errors.
Use a separate form for different academic years or different amounts. This will lessen inputting errors and speed up processing.
Preserve the formatting of the form, especially when pasting in data. The font size must be legible in order for Student Fees to be able to process the payment request.
Complete the relevant Payment Amendment Form for an amendment to an award that does not result in the student receiving increased money or a total reversal of the award.
Complete a Reversal Form where you require the total award to be completely reversed and not just amended.
Make sure that the correct academic year is used. If a form is input to the wrong year, the student may not be able to complete registration.?
Select the correct GL code for the award:

- 56041 for Alumni Bursary only
- 56042 for Fee waivers (for example, a reduction for mitigating circumstances)
- 56040 for all other awards
?

Select the correct Major Source of Funding code. This is always a two digit code. This is so that we can report scholarship information to HESA, it is essential for processing the form. A list of all the Major Source of Funding codes is provided here.
In order to increase an existing award to a student, please send another form for the extra amount only ¨C not for the new overall award total. The amendment form should be sent from an authorised signatory to FA1@leeds.ac.uk
Check that your Authorised Signatory List is up-to-date.
Check that there is enough budget in the account/cost object to cover the award payment.

Please do:
?

Not send replacement/duplicate forms, or forms which supersede previously submitted forms. In the event of a duplicate form being sent, Student fees accept no responsibility for duplicate forms being processed.
Not use the FA1 form to pay for work performed by the recipient for or on behalf of the University of Leeds. If you wish to make a payment directly to the student as an award or maintenance, use the MA1 form. These are processed by the Funding team.
Not add extra students to a form that has already been submitted. Please create a new form
Not alter the form from a landscape set up to portrait as this will affect the ability to input data.
Not leave mandatory fields blank.
Not scan the forms and send them as pdf attachments.
Not send reformat or change any part of the FA1 form.
Not re-send forms to FA1@leeds.ac.uk in order to query them. Any forms sent to this e-mail address are liable to be paid, so re-sending forms could result in a duplicate payment being made. Any queries should be sent to FA1queries@leeds.ac.uk

Changes to Awards/Querying Awards
If a payment needs to be altered, please email a completed Payment Amendment Form to FA1@leeds.ac.uk
If you have any queries regarding the processing of a payment, please contact Student Fees directly for further information.
When to Send an FA1 Form?
Student Fees receive in excess of 5,000 forms each year, mainly during our peak registration period in September. With this in mind, it would be very helpful if FA1¡¯s are sent in advance to ensure processing before registration (but after the general student record has been created in Banner).
Regardless of when the FA1 is processed your account will not be debited until the student completes online registration.
The award must not constitute a refund of an overpayment of accommodation or tuition fee payments made by the student to the University. The student should contact the Fees office directly to discuss the overpayment.
Processing Turnaround
Forms that are correctly completed and authorised will be processed within three working days of receipt. Please note that this may extend to five working days during busy periods.
If forms are completed incorrectly or budgets are exceeded, processing will be delayed and will be three working days from when the issue is resolved. This may require a new FA1 form being submitted with new authorisation.
Retention of FA1 forms
Copies of all FA1 forms should be retained by Schools/Faculties for the statutory retention period. FA1 forms will be retained by Student Fees for two years.

An Authorised Signatory emails the form directly to MA1@leeds.ac.uk (not cc-ed or bcc-ed).
If all necessary information has been provided and sent by an Authorised Signatory, Student Funding will enter the award on the Banner payment system. This will go into the weekly payment cycle matching the requested processing date (or the next available payment cycle if the date has already passed)?

?

Student Funding can only accept the approved version of the MA1 and Payment Amendment forms due to specific formatting requirements (available above). Any old versions of the form cannot be processed and therefore payments will not be made. Any Forms submitted by an unauthorised Signatory cannot be processed.

Forms: What to Use and How (the Dos and Don'ts)
Please note that the MA1 form uses macros to facilitate some of the built in functionality and?it is important that once you have finished using the MA1 form you completely close down Excel before continuing on with other work. If you do not completely close Excel?there can be issues with certain action (such as copy and pasting) that occur as a result of the Visual Basic for?Applications (VBA) programme continuing to run in the background.

Please do:

Check that the Cost Object Number quoted is in a valid format
Check that the Student ID number(s) quoted match the student listed
Use a separate form to lessen data input error opportunities where there is an obvious exception to the group of students being paid (e.g. different academic year or different amount)?
Preserve the formatting of the form, especially when pasting in data. The font size must be legible in order for?Student Funding?to be able to process the payment request. 
Remember to indicate in the Override Registration Requirement section on the MA1 form if a payment is required to be processed to a student who does not have a RE/RO registration status (see the Payment Requirements section). This will default to NO as standard.
?
For an amendment to an award that does not result in the student receiving increased money, complete the relevant pro forma Payment Amendment Form. This includes:?

- cancelling an award?
- suspending an award pending further instructions
- changing the cost object number
- reducing the amount of an award
- or changing the payment schedule








In order to increase an existing award to a student, please send another form for the extra amount only ¨C not for the new overall award total. The amendment form should be sent from an authorised signatory to MA1@leeds.ac.uk.
?

Check that your Authorised Signatory List is up-to-date.
For single lump sum awards choose a payment date which is a Tuesday.
For multiple instalment awards choose a start date which is the first day of the month and an end date which is the last day of the month.

?
Please do:
?

Not send replacement forms, or forms which supersede previously submitted forms.
Not send a form which span across the start/end date of the payee student¡¯s personal academic year.
Not alter the form from a landscape set up to portrait as this will affect the ability to input data.
Not leave mandatory fields blank.
Not scan the forms and send them as pdf attachments.
Not send reformat or change any part of the MA1 form.
Not re-send forms to MA1@leeds.ac.uk in order to query them. Any forms sent to this e-mail address are liable to be paid, so re-sending forms could result in a duplicate payment being made. Any queries should be sent to funding@leeds.ac.uk

MA1 forms should be used to pay any study-related payment to a registered student at the University including:

Bursaries and Scholarships
Prizes
Reimbursement of study-related expenses

MA1 forms cannot be used for the following:

To reimburse non-study related expenses
The award must not contain any element of payment for work performed by the recipient for or on behalf of the University of Leeds. Awards may only be paid to registered students of the University of Leeds. Payments for work done should be processed by Payroll.
The award must not constitute a refund of an overpayment of accommodation or tuition fee payments made by the student to the University. The student should contact the Fees office directly to discuss the overpayment.

Changes to Awards/Querying Awards
If a payment needs to be altered, please email a completed Pro Forma Payment Amendment Form to MA1@leeds.ac.uk
If you have any queries regarding the processing of a payment, please contact?Funding directly for further information.
Payment Processing Times
Student payments are processed by BACS (Bankers Automated Clearing System). The payment process is run weekly every Monday/Tuesday by the Student Funding team. and any due payment will clear in the student¡¯s designated bank accounts the following Friday. Forms must reach Funding at MA1@leeds.ac.uk by 4pm on a Thursday?to ensure inclusion in the following week¡¯s payment run (unless a payment date further in the future is requested).
Monthly payments are scheduled to be paid in advance, and are due on the 1st of each month. Because internal BACS processing restrictions mean payments can only clear on a Friday. Therefore to avoid disadvantaging students, where the 1st of the month does not fall on a Friday, payments are scheduled to clear the preceding Friday. Christmas, Easter and Bank Holidays may also impact on the exact payment date.?
For budgeting purposes students should always be informed that payments are due on the 1st of each month, and should not be advised of any other dates.
Payment Requirements
Student bank account details:
Students receiving an award need to supply their bank account details via the secure University Portal.
Registration status of the student:
Usually the University of Leeds will only process payments to registered students (Banner codes: RE or RO). An award will not be paid via the standard process whenever a student:

hasn't registered (Banner codes: EL, EN, ER, NR, NS)
has withdrawn (Banner codes: WD WA NA)
is under examination (Banner codes: UE) (see note below).
has suspended (Banner codes: CS, SF, SP)
is external (Banner codes EF, EP)


Please be aware that you will need to ensure that you identify on the MA1 form if you wish to pay a student an award where their status is anything other than RE/RO. There is a specific field on the MA1 form for this purpose. If a student¡¯s status changes after you have notified the funding team of an award then payments will be made in these situations if the individual case is agreed via email with a member of Funding, with an authorised signatory copied in.
Where the student is not RE/RO and no extra arrangement is made, overdue instalments remain pending on their file. If the student does later become RE/RO for the academic year of their award, overdue instalments will be processed to reach the bank account as a single sum in the following payment cycle.
Payments over multiple academic years:
To request an award outside the student¡¯s academic year, typically two MA1 forms need to be raised. The first to pay x number of instalments, taking the award to the start of the student¡¯s academic year. The second to pay the balance of the award over the remaining months.
Retention of MA1 Forms

Copies of all MA1 forms should be retained by Schools/Faculties for the statutory retention period. For Research Council funded students a copy of all MA1 forms should be retained by Schools/Faculties for up to 12 months after the grant has closed. MA1 forms will be retained by Funding for two years.
Argos Report for Staff
An Argos report has been developed for staff, enabling them to determine i) which students have awards set up against a particular cost object number, ii) whether the awards have been paid, and iii) if the awards have not yet been paid, what cause of non-payment is likely to be. Staff can find instructions for using the Argos report here.

?

Check that the Cost Object Number quoted is in a valid format
Check that the Student ID number(s) quoted match the student listed

Use a separate form for different academic years or different amounts. This will lessen inputting errors and speed up processing.
Preserve the formatting of the form, especially when pasting in data. The font size must be legible in order for Student Fees to be able to process the payment request.
Complete the relevant Payment Amendment Form for an amendment to an award that does not result in the student receiving increased money or a total reversal of the award.
Complete a Reversal Form where you require the total award to be completely reversed and not just amended.
Make sure that the correct academic year is used. If a form is input to the wrong year, the student may not be able to complete registration.?
Select the correct GL code for the award:

- 56041 for Alumni Bursary only
- 56042 for Fee waivers (for example, a reduction for mitigating circumstances)
- 56040 for all other awards
?

Select the correct Major Source of Funding code. This is always a two digit code. This is so that we can report scholarship information to HESA, it is essential for processing the form. A list of all the Major Source of Funding codes is provided here.
In order to increase an existing award to a student, please send another form for the extra amount only ¨C not for the new overall award total. The amendment form should be sent from an authorised signatory to FA1@leeds.ac.uk

Please do:
?

Not send replacement/duplicate forms, or forms which supersede previously submitted forms. In the event of a duplicate form being sent, Student fees accept no responsibility for duplicate forms being processed.
Not use the FA1 form to pay for work performed by the recipient for or on behalf of the University of Leeds. If you wish to make a payment directly to the student as an award or maintenance, use the MA1 form. These are processed by the Funding team.
Not add extra students to a form that has already been submitted. Please create a new form
Not alter the form from a landscape set up to portrait as this will affect the ability to input data.
Not leave mandatory fields blank.
Not scan the forms and send them as pdf attachments.
Not send reformat or change any part of the FA1 form.
Not re-send forms to FA1@leeds.ac.uk in order to query them. Any forms sent to this e-mail address are liable to be paid, so re-sending forms could result in a duplicate payment being made. Any queries should be sent to FA1queries@leeds.ac.uk

Changes to Awards/Querying Awards
If a payment needs to be altered, please email a completed Payment Amendment Form to FA1@leeds.ac.uk
If you have any queries regarding the processing of a payment, please contact Student Fees directly for further information.
When to Send an FA1 Form?
Student Fees receive in excess of 5,000 forms each year, mainly during our peak registration period in September. With this in mind, it would be very helpful if FA1¡¯s are sent in advance to ensure processing before registration (but after the general student record has been created in Banner).
Regardless of when the FA1 is processed your account will not be debited until the student completes online registration.
The award must not constitute a refund of an overpayment of accommodation or tuition fee payments made by the student to the University. The student should contact the Fees office directly to discuss the overpayment.
Processing Turnaround
Forms that are correctly completed and authorised will be processed within three working days of receipt. Please note that this may extend to five working days during busy periods.
If forms are completed incorrectly or budgets are exceeded, processing will be delayed and will be three working days from when the issue is resolved. This may require a new FA1 form being submitted with new authorisation.
Retention of FA1 forms
Copies of all FA1 forms should be retained by Schools/Faculties for the statutory retention period. FA1 forms will be retained by Student Fees for two years.

Tuition Payment for Sponsored students,"If a student is being supported by a third party organisation (but not Student Finance or a Research council) they are considered to be sponsored. Proof is required before the student can register.
Sponsor letters
Students with sponsorship must provide evidence of their sponsorship to register at the University, this has to be in an acceptable format?and contain specific information. Information regarding what is required is available on the Sponsored Students?page of the SES student website.
We will invoice sponsors directly for the annual academic fees, this should be paid within 30 days from when they?receive the invoice.
Sponsor evidence for deposit payers
International taught postgraduate students may be asked to provide evidence of sponsorship during the application process. Because this evidence is provided at such an early stage it does not always adhere to the strict rules for registration.
If a student is not sure if their evidence has been accepted for registration they should?email their sponsor?letter to?sponsors@leeds.ac.uk 
Do we need the original letter?
In most cases, sponsors can email us a non-editable version of the sponsor letter: for example, a scanned document, PDF or image file.?Sponsor letters?should be sent to sponsors@leeds.ac.uk 
What if the sponsor does not pay?
If a sponsor does not pay the liability for the payment of fees lies with the student.?Up to date information on this policy?is maintained on the Sponsored students page of the SES student website."
Reduced fees and returners,"If a taught student needs their fee reducing this must be calculated manually. Schools must notify the Student Fees team for this to happen.
Banner?will charge 100% of the fee for the academic session by default. If the student shouldn¡¯t be paying?the full tuition fee a manual reduction is required. You can request waivers by Form 21 and reductions using a Form R. A Form Z can be used to cancel a fee if it is paid for by block-funding.
It is the responsibility of the School/Faculty to identify when a reduction is required, Student Fees will not prompt you to submit a form. Student Fees are happy to provide guidance - please email UGfees@leeds.ac.uk or PGfees@leeds.ac.uk or call ext. 36700 for support.
Processes may change, refer to this page or the Student Fees team before completing your form or informing a student of the process.
FA1 form?¨C Covering fees (Fee Waivers)

A Form R is used to reduce the tuition fee charged. When a fee is reduced using a Form R financial support, HESA data and funding to Schools will be affected. Fee reductions cannot be reversed.

Re-sitting internally or returning from temporary leave
Students can be allowed to resit their studies internally or return from temporary leave part-way through a year. Students must be charged for the time that they are studying. The charging principles vary to reflect student funding eligibility.

Undergraduate Home/EU
	UG Home/EU students will be charged for the term they will be registering for not the credits they will be taking. This is in line with the Student Finance charging policy (100% for three terms, 75% for term 2 and 3 and 50% for term 3 only).
Undergraduate Overseas and all Taught postgraduate students
	UG Overseas and all Taught postgraduate students will be charged for the months they are taking or credits they are studying, depending which is cheaper.

Returning students cannot be charged less than the full value of their programme. Reductions and waivers should be provided by Form 21.
One year programmes?(eg FT Masters) are not fixed at entry. Students who return in a different session will be charged at the current rate for their programme in the year in which they return. ??
Reduced Credits due to Accreditation of Prior Learning
Students who have brought with them credits from a previous course are entitled to a reduced fee in line with their offer letter, this can be requested by completing a Form R.
If you reduce a fee using Form R, this may have an impact on a student's entitlement to University of Leeds and/or external funding.
You must advise each student to contact the Student Funding team so that they understand the financial impact of registering with reduced fees - funding@leeds.ac.uk

Professional Doctorate,"Professional Doctorates are research degrees specifically designed to meet the needs of practising professionals.?Find out more.
Key characteristics of the Professional
Doctorate programme
 
Professional Doctorates are research degrees specifically designed to meet the needs of practicing professionals. Although professional doctorates involve a number of taught modules in the first year of the research degree the majority of the programme involves a research project and the writing of a thesis in the same way as the more traditional PhD.?
The
normal duration of a Professional Doctorate is 3 years full time and 5 years part time. If the professional doctorate
is designed to meet the needs of a professional body this might lead to a full
time programme only.
The
professional doctorate will have a specific title that reflects the discipline of
the area of research.? It very frequently
leads to the creation of a new degree type which has to be approved by Graduate
Board and Senate as seen in the current Leeds professional doctorates:
 

Doctor of Education (EdD)
Doctor of Clinical Psychology (DClinPsychol)
Doctor of Paediatric Dentistry (DPaedDent)
Doctor of Clinical Education (DClinEdD)

 
 
Programme Title and Learning Outcomes
 

Professional Doctorates have a
distinctive degree title, which can? introduce?a new
degree type that needs to be approved by Graduate Board and Senate and which will
be added to the Ordinances and Regulations
If a new degree type is necessary it is
approved ?at the
same time as the programme
The professional doctorate will have its own
set of Learning Outcomes that are approved as part of the programme approval
process

 
 
The design of the programme

The
 professional doctorate follows all the usual requirements of a research
 degree: supervisions from the start of the candidature, research skills
 training, Training Plans, use of GRAD etc.
The
 professional doctorate includes a requirement to follow all the
 usual milestones of a research degree including the Transfer process and
 Annual progress review and Viva
Professional
 doctorates include taught elements?that include M level PGT modules
 (level 5)
As a
 professional doctorate includes taught credit the programme will be
 externally reviewed as part of the approval process
There
 are a maximum of?credits included in a Professional Doctorate 150
 credits or 180 credits

 
Assessment and
Progression Points

Modules
 included in a professional doctorate have a pass mark of 50 and?
 these must be passed?as stipulated in the programme
All
 taught modules should be completed prior to the Transfer stage unless
 the module in the post Transfer? period involves a professional
 Placement that is a requirement for professional practice purposes
As a
 research degree the final award is based on a supervised research project
 and viva
The
 submitted thesis is frequently shorter than the traditional PhD thesis
 55,000 - 80,000 words
A
 Diploma Supplement is provided alongside the Degree Certificate and the
 modules taken, titles and number of credits, along with the marks awarded
 will be noted there

 
Quality assurance
As is
 the case for all programmes with taught?modules the modules will be
 reviewed and?an external examiner will be appointed for the
 programme. Their role is to comment on the programme as a whole?and
 is designed specifically to be independent of the research thesis
 component, related?thesis submission and examination process
 
Prior Learning as
APEL at Admissions
As
 professional doctorates include taught modules the University¡¯s policy on
 APEL should be considered and the programme team must set down how APEL
 will be addressed when the programme is submitted for approval. This
 ensures that the policy to?be applied is clear and can be made
 available to applicants at the admissions stage.
 
Please note: APEL applies only to taught credit - it does not
apply to the research components at any stage.

Integrated PhD,"The Integrated PhD involves a combination of taught specialist modules, training and skills courses, and research study. 
Key Characteristics of the Integrated PhD
 
The Integrated PhD involves a combination of taught specialist modules, training and skills courses, and research study. This allows Postgraduate Researchers (PGRs) to broaden and deepen subject knowledge and to extend their expertise in new directions. 
The integrated Degree of PhD and Masters is a four year full-time programme?where PGRs study a combination of taught modules (split across Years 1 and 2) and produce?a standard PhD length research thesis by the end?of year 4. These are commonly, but not exclusively, part of a Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT).
Consider the following key characteristics of Integrated PhD during the planning process:
 

This is a 4 year degree programme that integrates the Masters programme with a PhD with a single point of entry September/October
The integrated PhD results in a single degree: Integrated Degree of PhD and (named title) and the PGR receives just the one certificate of that title
The Masters programme can be awarded as a Pass, with Merit or Distinction (this is acknowledged on the degree certificate)
The 180 credits of taught masters content is split across the first two years of the 4 year programme
Ideally the credit to complete the masters is less in the second year than in the first to allow the research project to be developed in readiness for the Transfer. There should nevertheless be a workable balance so that the PGR is not overloaded in any of these two years
The PGR still has to complete a First Formal Progress meeting that takes place at the end of year 1 of the 4 year programme
Research activity and research skills training takes place alongside the taught content in years 1 and 2 and related activities such as summer schools and other training events continue during the course of the programme
The taught Masters programme must have been completed before Transfer and this must be Passed as part of the progression requirements for Transfer
The Transfer takes place at the end of year 2 of the 4 year programme
An External Examiner will be appointed to oversee? the taught MSc programme according to the requirements of the rules for award. The requirements for progression and classification of this award will follow the standard requirements for taught programmes.
The Masters programme is not awarded as a separate degree at the end of the second year, but is ¡®banked¡¯ at this point and is awarded only as part of the Integrated PhD Award after successful completion of the viva examination in the final year.
If?a PGR leaves the programme before the final thesis examination is assessed and provided that they have successfully completed and passed the relevant credit for the taught award then the Masters (MSc) degree or one of its?interim awards such as PG Cert or PG Dip could be awarded as an exit award
After the end of year 2, and?successful completion of both the MSc and the PhD Transfer, the PhD follows the same pattern as the standard PhD programme with?the PGR undertaking an?Annual Progress Review at the end of Year 3 and submission of a thesis by the end of year 4
The thesis submitted is of the same length as that?for the standard PhD

 
Creating a New Integrated PhD with a collaborative partner in another university? Please discuss the proposal with Doctoral College Programmes as soon as possible.

For Integrated PhDs that are delivered in collaboration with another university, a collaborative arrangement is entered into and a Collaborative Agreement must be approved along with the programme specification.
Once approved the collaborative arrangement is added to the University¡¯s Collaborative register
In addition,?the arrangement may be subject to a separate UKVI Sites and Partnership Arrangement this will be determined at the outline planning approval stage

Practice-led PhD,"It is important to distinguish practice-led applicants from the outset to ensure that candidates (and their supervisors) are aware of the arrangements for practice-led candidatures. 
Key Characteristics of
Practice-led Awards
The practice-led format is available only for PhD and MPhil research
degrees
The practice-led PhD is only offered by the
following schools:
 

School of English
School of Media and Communication
School of Fine Art, History of Art & Cultural
Studies
School of Music
School of Performance & Cultural Industries
School of Design

 
 
 
The
Candidature
 

The requirements for the award are set down in an
approved University Protocol for practice-led research degree candidatures and
these are specific to the Faculty of Arts, Humanities and Cultures (AHC)
The Faculty of
AHC is responsible for arranging a number of training sessions for practice-led
research, which are available to practice-led Postgraduate Researchers (PGRs)?
It is not
possible for PGRs who have already passed the transfer on a non-practice-led
PhD? to change to a practice-led research
degree.?

 
The Transfer

At transfer
stage, the candidate and School are required to clarify that the research
project is still defined as practice-led.?
A practice
element should be a mandatory submission requirement at transfer assessment,
which is indicative of the practice. This could be a contained performance,
small installation or concept to demonstrate practice. The PGR must be required
to demonstrate the ability to link practice with the written analysis.
It is important
to identify at transfer stage if the candidate intends to? include live performance or practice as part
of the final submission and, if this will take place prior to submission of the
written element, to facilitate arrangements for the early appointment of
examiners
In addition to
the usual requirements for transfer, a practice-led candidate must set out what
he/she expects to include for assessment as the final submission. This must
meet the regulations for alternative submissions as set out in the Ordinances.?

 
 
The Thesis/Final Submission and Viva
 

Where it is
considered to be part of the final submission, examiners are normally expected
to view live practice. However, all practice for assessment must be recorded
in an appropriate format as a permanent record (see 4.4 below).?
The ¡®Practice-led
Research Degree Exam Entry Form¡¯ must be completed and returned to Postgraduate
Research and Operations a minimum of 3 months prior to the date of the first
live practice

Dual PhD,"Find out what they key characteristics of collaborative dual awards are.?
Key Characteristics of Collaborative Dual Awards

A Dual Award is a research degree delivered jointly in collaboration with another university that not only has degree awarding powers but whose statutes permit dual collaborative research awards
A dual PhD leads to two separate PhD awards: one from Leeds University and the second from the university with which we have the collaborative arrangement
The Degree Certificate will indicate that this is a Dual PhD in collaboration with a second and named university
To obtain both PhD awards, the PGR must successfully complete the programme requirements and meet the learning outcomes for both research degrees from each institution
The standard period of study for a dual research degree award mirrors that for PhD programmes and does not extend beyond 4 years.
After consideration by the Faculty Graduate School Committee, a dual award must be recommended for approval by PGR Programmes and Quality Group a sub-committee and approved by Graduate Board before any arrangements can be put in place to deliver the programme. This includes the making of an offer of a place

Joint PhD,"A Joint PhD is single PhD degree that is awarded jointly by two or more universities who have collaborated in the design and delivery of a specific doctoral degree that each university has approved though its deliberative structures.
Key Characteristics of Collaborative Joint PhD Awards
Joint degrees have the additional complexity of having to bring together the partner institutions¡¯ policies, requirements and academic regulations to design the single PhD
?
Characteristics of Joint PhD Approval Arrangements

This is a research degree that is offered with another university that not only has degree awarding powers but whose statutes permit joint collaborative research degree awards.
This is a single PhD degree that is awarded jointly by two or more universities who have collaborated in the design and delivery of a specific doctoral degree that each university has approved though its deliberative structures.
All universities who deliver this specific PhD do so with the aim of offering a single degree certificate with all universities named. It is jointly delivered, jointly assessed and jointly awarded.
A joint PhD has a single set of agreed regulations that each university agrees to and these are approved specifically by each institution for this programme.
All requirements for Transfer and the final thesis submission and examination will be approved as part of the approvals process and set down at the start of the candidature.
If it is mandatory on the part of the collaborating partner to register the forthcoming collaborative arrangement so that this meets local requirements these details must be sought at an early stage and Leeds advised. No offers of a place will be made until any such requirements have been met.
After consideration by the Faculty Graduate School Committee, a Joint PhD award must be recommended for approval by PGR Programmes and Quality Group and approved by Graduate Board before any arrangements can be put in place to deliver the programme. This includes the making of an offer of a place.
Any proposal taken forward must be both financially viable and sustainable not just in year 1 but in subsequent years. This will require discussions with both Faculty Finance and Faculty Marketing both of which will have to contribute to the rationale as to why the programme should be considered for outline planning approval.
There will be a site visit to ensure the availability of appropriate facilities to undertake the research as required and for the duration of the research degree as well as a Due Diligence requirement.
A Collaborative Agreement will be drafted by the University¡¯s Legal Advisor and must be signed by all parties before PGRs are made an offer of a place at Leeds.

Split site PhD,"Find out more about the key characteristics of split site programmes.?
Key Characteristics of Split Site Programmes

There are 3 models of Split site PhD. Model A is full time, Model B is part time, and Model C is full time with a lower requirement for attendance at Leeds.
Whilst other institutions will be involved to some extent in the delivery of the split site research degree, it will lead only to a Leeds PhD.
Standard requirements for admissions apply to split site PhD and applicants must attain a band score of 6.5 in IELTS with no component below 6.0.
Model A will require an Agreement to be drafted by the University¡¯s Legal Advisor.? Model B and Model C will require an Agreement where multiple candidates are to be recruited.
Schools will ensure the availability of appropriate facilities to undertake the research for the duration of the degree, either through a site visit or, where appropriate, through discussion with the partner; this information to be provided in the Split-site Recommendation Form.
There will be a local advisor/supervisor appointed and details of this will be included in the Agreement.
The attendance requirements at Leeds are based on key milestones of induction, transfer, annual progress monitoring and examination.
Specific study, assessment and examination arrangements must be discussed and confirmed at the application stage.
Supervisions by video conferencing or telephone call are permitted when the PGR is not resident at Leeds. Email exchanges do not meet the requirement for a supervisory meeting.
PGRs registered on a split site research degree will use GRAD to lodge all notes of meetings and for progression milestones.
In cases where a number of PGRs are recruited each year from a named institution a link Academic Tutor will be nominated for the programme to maintain academic oversight.
The collaborative arrangement is added to the University¡¯s Collaborative register

Where a provider works in partnership with other organisations, it has in place effective arrangements to ensure that the academic experience is high-quality irrespective of where or how courses are delivered and who delivers them (QAA core practice for partnerships, 2018)

Reduced time at Leeds for postgraduate researchers,"Postgraduate researchers may undertake a limited amount of research away from the University, either on approved fieldwork or in approved academic institutions or scientific, clinical or industrial locations.
This could apply to postgraduate researchers studying under Marie Curie ITN initiatives, Horizon 2020 or as part of industrial sponsorship. Split-site programmes are considered under a seperate process.
Schools should set out the planned arrangements and make a request to Doctoral College Operations?if it is anticipated that this?time away will exceed 12 months of the total period of study. Transfer and examination must?take place at the University of Leeds.?
The following information should be included:
?

Details of the programme, including any partners involved in the project
Reasons for why the PGR is not able to undertake this research at the University of Leeds?
The locations where the PGR will be studying
A proposed schedule of study, including a month-by-month breakdown of activity to undertaken and in which location
Details of any visits by the supervisor(s) to the proposed location
How the supervision team will continue regular supervision meetings during the PGR's time away from the University

This request will then be considered by the Chair of PGR Programmes and Quality Group. PGRs studying under a Student visa must declare any change of location to Doctoral College Operations ?
?
?
"
Examiners' joint report forms (postgraduate research),"The appropriate examiners' joint report form should be completed by the examiners at the end of the viva.
?
Scanned/electronic signatures can be accepted for an all video-streaming viva (this is preferred, but email confirmation form all examiners can be accepted in place of this). All sections of the report must be typed using the template provided below. If the recommendation is that the thesis be referred for resubmission the examiners must also prepare notes for guidance and return these with the final report. The notes for guidance must be typed, headed ""notes for guidance"" and attached to the final examiners' report form.
Please ensure that you answer all questions clearly and fully and include in your responses specific examples from the thesis.??
Once completed, the internal examiner should send the report to the Graduate School within 10 working days of the viva to arrange for review by DoPGRS. The Graduate School will then submit the report to Doctoral College Operations.?
?
Examiners should use the correct form for the degree being examined.
Preliminary Report
Each examiner needs to complete a preliminary report form before the postgraduate research degree viva. There are separate forms depending on whether it is a first submission or a resubmission.?

Video streaming for a final research degree oral examination (research students),"In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, arrangements have been made to allow transfer and final vivas to take place by video streaming. The policy is available below.?
Updated April 2022: Vivas may take place as follows, depending on the circumstances and preferences of participants: 

Fully remote: Arrangements remain in place for the viva to take place by video streaming, with all parties completing this process remotely (Teams or Zoom).?
Fully in person (all parties together on campus for a face-to-face viva)
Hybrid?(some parties are face to face whilst others in the meeting are video streaming).??This could include the PGR and internal examiner being co-located on Campus, with the external examiner joining via video-streaming or the examiners being co-located, with the PGR joining via video-streaming.

H&S protocols are regularly updated and internal examiners should take into consideration any H&S regulations relating to meetings in place at the time of viva. ?
The longer-term approach to vivas (session 2022/23 onwards) is currently under review by Graduate Board and its committees. Doctoral College Operations would particularly welcome feedback from participants of any ¡®hybrid¡¯ vivas to feed into the review of longer-term video-streamed vivas. This can be sent to rp_examinations@adm.leeds.ac.uk
Also provided is a?Hints, tips and good practice document, which has been collated from feedback from internal examiners, independent chairs and PGRs who have completed an all-video-streaming viva since March 2020. ?This document also includes details of the ODPL training available to Internal Examiners and PGRs for a video-streamed viva.
From January 2021, the requirement for an Independent Chair for an online final viva has been withdrawn, where the examining team is otherwise experienced. An independent chair can still be appointed for an online viva, on request from the examining team, and a Chair will still?required by the University under the established (pre- Covid-19) position where it will the internal examiner¡¯s first PGR examination or a second viva on resubmission. A chair will not be required for a transfer viva.
PGRs are advised to contact Disability Services at the earliest opportunity to discuss any?reasonable adjustments and/or additional support that may be needed for an online transfer or final viva. Further advice can be found in the document below.

Applications for postgraduate research degrees,"Postgraduate researcher (PGR) applicants?apply online.?Applications are handled by relevant Graduates Schools and offers are made by the Postgraduate Research and Operations
How do applicants apply?
PGR applicants can?apply online, where they are able to track their application at each stage of the process.??
Schools may be approached by potential PGR visitors. To be eligible for PGR miscellaneous study the applicant must be studying a research degree elsewhere and visiting the University of Leeds to undertake research toward this degree.?
What makes a complete application?
As well as a fully completed application form, the following supporting information is needed before a decision can be made on an application:

degree certificate(s) and academic transcripts 
evidence of English language proficiency if required 
Either a brief description of the general research area of interest or a research proposal? 
two references?(as advised by the academic school) 

What happens after applications are made?
Once an applicant has submitted their application, they receive an automated acknowledgement email. This email will include a reminder of?the applicant¡¯s login ID and PIN, which they will need to re-enter the online admission pages to track their application. Once an application has been submitted, the applicant can login and track its progress at any time.?
Once the school has received the application then potential supervisors and other admissions staff will consider it. An interview must also take place.
Once the school has made a decision, Postgraduate Research and Operations will:?

authorise the school's decision? 
check the supporting evidence? 
issue the offer letter, along with information on how to respond 


Fees assessment
In some circumstances it is not clear what fee status an applicant should be. In these cases the applicant must complete a fees assessment form, which is considered by PGR & Operations.?All fees assessments undertaken by the University of Leeds are in line with UKCISA guidance.
"
Conditions of acceptance for postgraduate researcher applicants,"Applicants who have been offered a place subject to the award of a previous qualification must provide evidence of this prior to registration.
The University requires clear evidence of the award of the qualification, in English. It is the new PGR's responsibility to ensure that the evidence meets our requirements, which are as follows:?

We expect that the evidence be from central registry, central administration or equivalent at the previous university. If the previous university does not award degrees centrally then the new PGR can provide a document from central registry, central administration or equivalent that?confirms this, in addition to the qualification evidence from their faculty. 
The evidence must clearly state the person's name and this must match the details that we hold on record. 
The evidence must clearly state the name of the qualification. If the offer is subject to a specific mark, this must also be clearly stated in the same format as is specified on the offer letter. 
If the evidence is not in the form of an official degree certificate or final transcript then we require that the new PGR provides an official letter on university-headed paper, from central registry, central administration or equivalent, confirming all relevant details. 
If the previous university cannot provide evidence of the award in English then it is acceptable for the new PGR to provide a translation from an official translation service, but we do require sight of the original certificate or final transcript too.? 
If the new PGR has completed a course but not yet received formal notification of the award, evidence that all the required work has been completed must be provided to Postgraduate Research and Operations prior to registration. 
  This evidence should take the form of a letter and must:

be in English 
be issued on university-headed paper 
be issued by the school or central administration (including those who have completed a taught master's/previous programme at the University of Leeds) 
confirm that all components for the course have been completed 
include any provisional results available (not all universities issue provisional results, including the?University of Leeds) 
state: 'I confirm that this student is highly likely to successfully complete their programme' 
be signed or stamped 
confirm the date the qualification is due to be awarded 

On production of this evidence new PGRs can complete registration subject to providing formal notification within a specified time period (usually?three months). The offer of a place to study letter will also state this.?Failure to provide this could result in withdrawal.
Please note that it is the new PGR's responsibility to acquire this evidence. Staff in Postgraduate Research and Operations are unable to offer assistance with this during the registration process."
English language requirements for postgraduate researchers ,"Postgraduate research students will need an English language qualification at a high level?if they wish to study at the University of Leeds.?

The University's standards comply with the QAA Code of Practice for Postgraduate Research Programmes and also meet UKVI English language standards in respect of applying for a?student visa.?

Standard requirements: IELTS
The minimum English language entry requirement for research postgraduate study is an IELTS of 6.0 overall with at least 5.5 in each component (reading, writing, listening and speaking). IELTS results must be dated within two years of the start date of the course in order to be valid.
Faculties, schools and programmes with a higher English language requirement
A school or faculty can raise the required minimum level of English above the University minimum but cannot lower it.
A higher level of English of an IELTS at 6.5 overall, with at least 6.0 in?each component,?is required in the following schools and faculties:?

Faculty of Medicine and Health
Faculty of Arts, Humanities and Cultures
School of Education
School of Food Science and Nutrition
School of Politics and International Studies
School of Sociology and Social Policy

Minimum requirements in other schools and programmes:

Leeds University Business School requires an IELTS?of?7.0 overall with at least 6.0 in each component.
The School of Fine Art, History of Art and Cultural Studies requires an IELTS of 6.5 overall with?at least 7.0 in writing and?at least 6.0 in?reading, listening and?speaking.
The School of Law requires an?IELTS of 7.0?overall?with no less than 6.5 in any component.
The Professional Doctorate and the Integrated degree of PhD and MSc in Clinical Dentistry in the Leeds Dental Institute require an IELTS of 7.0 overall with at least 6.5 in each component.
All split-site modes of study require an IELTS of 6.5 overall with at least 6.0 in each component.

Alternative qualifications and further information
The Research Postgraduate Admissions Policy provides information and on minimum standards of English language and other accepted qualifications, approved on a University-wide basis by the Graduate Board. Please contact Doctoral College Admissions?if you have any questions that are not covered in the policy.?
Applicants who do not meet the English language requirement
If you have a candidate with a strong academic profile who falls just short of the English language entry requirements, they can be given a conditional offer subject to successfully completing a pre-sessional English language course.
In exceptional circumstances, schools may wish to make a special case for an applicant to be accepted despite not meeting the standard English language requirement.
The case must be made on the English language case template and all sections should be completed, including the reason why the applicant cannot meet the standard requirement.?
If the applicant will require a student visa to study in the UK then there is only scope for a case if the applicant has met the English language requirements for their visa application - they must be at CEFR B2, which is an IELTS of 5.5, with at least 5.5 in each component. If the applicant is below this?level in any area then the case cannot be considered.
Please see the English language case template for more information.
"
Exceptional cases for postgraduate research admission,"If an applicant does not meet the usual entry requirements, or the school would like special arrangements to be made for the applicant, the school must make a case for the applicant to be accepted.
Cases are considered by the Chair of Programmes of Study and Audit Group.
This is normally a request for an applicant to be admitted without meeting the standard entry requirements, or for an applicant intending to spend more than 12 months of full-time study based away from the University.?
An essential component of any case is the demonstration of the applicant's suitability to undertake their course of study at the required level. We will require evidence to support this, including any assessment made, e.g. interview notes, professional and relevant experience, assessment of their research proposal or any other written work. The school must also demonstrate how the applicant will be supported during their study. All assessments must take place at the University of Leeds.?
Contact PGR & Operations, who will be able to provide guidance if required.?

English language cases?

When an applicant does meet the minimum University English language requirements, a case must be made using the English language case template.
Cases must not be made to avoid taking an English language test, e.g. if the applicant does not have sufficient time to take the test before their proposed start date.?
A case should only be made when there is a reason to believe that the applicant has a level of English that is appropriate for?their course of study at the required level. A example is where an?applicant has an out-of-date English language qualification but has maintained their use of English.

"
Induction for postgraduate researchers,"A good induction can help PGRs settle in quickly and begin to make early progress with their research.
Postgraduate researchers are provided with a PGR handbook which brings together key rules, regulations and guidance which form the framework of the degree. Copies of the handbook are available on the Doctoral College Minerva organisation or from your faculty Graduate School.??
The handbook includes:

the University's Code of practice for research degree candidatures
ordinances and regulations and programmes of study for research degrees?which include entry requirements, assessment of progress, time limits for examination and criteria for the award of research degrees

University welcome event
All new postgraduate researchers?are encouraged to attend the University welcome event. They are formally welcomed to the University by Professor Luke Windsor, Dean of Postgraduate Research Studies, signposted to key areas of the University, the resources and facilities available.
There is also the opportunity to meet many other new postgraduate researchers.
Students are notified of forthcoming welcome events by email, with an invitation to register online.
Information provided by schools and faculties
Schools should provide students with any local information about the administrative and academic arrangements for undertaking research within that school or faculty. This could include:

information on the specific facilities that are available to PGRs
relevant health and safety advice
opportunities for participating in conferences
information about social and extra-mural activities

You may also provide information about the training that is available through OD&PL.
Information provided by the International Student Office

Maintenance awards,"The Student Funding team, within the Student Education Service, processes student award payments on behalf of their School (for example, as part of a postgraduate maintenance award) or on behalf of a University Service.
All awards will need to be submitted on MA1 forms to the MA1@leeds.ac.uk inbox from that point onwards.?
Please note that the Doctoral College administer centrally funded (University) scholarships and awards separately.
Forms?

MA1 Form¨C used to authorise either one-off lump sum or regular monthly maintenance payments. Up to 20 student payments can be included on each form.
Maintenance Payment Amendment Form ¨C used to notify the Student Funding team of an amendment to an existing? student maintenance award

Guidance documentation
?

Guidance document ¨C this is a detailed overview of how to complete the forms, where to send them, and how to request an amendment to an award.?

Process Overview: Notifying Funding
?

Individual in the School or Service completes an MA1 form
An Authorised Signatory emails the form directly to MA1@leeds.ac.uk (not cc-ed or bcc-ed).
If all necessary information has been provided and sent by an Authorised Signatory, Student Funding will enter the award on the Banner payment system. This will go into the weekly payment cycle matching the requested processing date (or the next available payment cycle if the date has already passed)?

?

Student Funding can only accept the approved version of the MA1 and Payment Amendment forms due to specific formatting requirements (available above). Any old versions of the form cannot be processed and therefore payments will not be made. Any Forms submitted by an unauthorised Signatory cannot be processed.

Forms: What to Use and How (the Dos and Don'ts)
Please note that the MA1 form uses macros to facilitate some of the built in functionality and?it is important that once you have finished using the MA1 form you completely close down Excel before continuing on with other work. If you do not completely close Excel?there can be issues with certain action (such as copy and pasting) that occur as a result of the Visual Basic for?Applications (VBA) programme continuing to run in the background.

Not re-send forms to MA1@leeds.ac.uk in order to query them. Any forms sent to this e-mail address are liable to be paid, so re-sending forms could result in a duplicate payment being made. Any queries should be sent to funding@leeds.ac.uk

MA1 forms should be used to pay any study-related payment to a registered student at the University including:

Bursaries and Scholarships
Prizes
Reimbursement of study-related expenses

MA1 forms cannot be used for the following:

To reimburse non-study related expenses
The award must not contain any element of payment for work performed by the recipient for or on behalf of the University of Leeds. Awards may only be paid to registered students of the University of Leeds. Payments for work done should be processed by Payroll.
The award must not constitute a refund of an overpayment of accommodation or tuition fee payments made by the student to the University. The student should contact the Fees office directly to discuss the overpayment.

Changes to Awards/Querying Awards
If a payment needs to be altered, please email a completed Pro Forma Payment Amendment Form to MA1@leeds.ac.uk
If you have any queries regarding the processing of a payment, please contact?Funding directly for further information.
Payment Processing Times
Student payments are processed by BACS (Bankers Automated Clearing System). The payment process is run weekly every Monday/Tuesday by the Student Funding team. and any due payment will clear in the student¡¯s designated bank accounts the following Friday. Forms must reach Funding at MA1@leeds.ac.uk by 4pm on a Thursday?to ensure inclusion in the following week¡¯s payment run (unless a payment date further in the future is requested).
Monthly payments are scheduled to be paid in advance, and are due on the 1st of each month. Because internal BACS processing restrictions mean payments can only clear on a Friday. Therefore to avoid disadvantaging students, where the 1st of the month does not fall on a Friday, payments are scheduled to clear the preceding Friday. Christmas, Easter and Bank Holidays may also impact on the exact payment date.?
For budgeting purposes students should always be informed that payments are due on the 1st of each month, and should not be advised of any other dates.
Payment Requirements
Student bank account details:
Students receiving an award need to supply their bank account details via the secure University Portal.
Registration status of the student:
Usually the University of Leeds will only process payments to registered students (Banner codes: RE or RO). An award will not be paid via the standard process whenever a student:

hasn't registered (Banner codes: EL, EN, ER, NR, NS)
has withdrawn (Banner codes: WD WA NA)
is under examination (Banner codes: UE) (see note below).
has suspended (Banner codes: CS, SF, SP)
is external (Banner codes EF, EP)


Please be aware that you will need to ensure that you identify on the MA1 form if you wish to pay a student an award where their status is anything other than RE/RO. There is a specific field on the MA1 form for this purpose. If a student¡¯s status changes after you have notified the funding team of an award then payments will be made in these situations if the individual case is agreed via email with a member of Funding, with an authorised signatory copied in.
Where the student is not RE/RO and no extra arrangement is made, overdue instalments remain pending on their file. If the student does later become RE/RO for the academic year of their award, overdue instalments will be processed to reach the bank account as a single sum in the following payment cycle.
Payments over multiple academic years:
To request an award outside the student¡¯s academic year, typically two MA1 forms need to be raised. The first to pay x number of instalments, taking the award to the start of the student¡¯s academic year. The second to pay the balance of the award over the remaining months.
Retention of MA1 Forms

Copies of all MA1 forms should be retained by Schools/Faculties for the statutory retention period. For Research Council funded students a copy of all MA1 forms should be retained by Schools/Faculties for up to 12 months after the grant has closed. MA1 forms will be retained by Funding for two years.
Argos Report for Staff
An Argos report has been developed for staff, enabling them to determine i) which students have awards set up against a particular cost object number, ii) whether the awards have been paid, and iii) if the awards have not yet been paid, what cause of non-payment is likely to be. Staff can find instructions for using the Argos report here.

Postgraduate researcher - admission start dates/changes of start date,"
There are a number of factors to consider when choosing initial start dates for applicants. You can also find out the process for change of start date, after a formal offer has been made.

Choosing an initial start date
Schools need to check whether the start date the applicant has requested is feasible. The decision about the start date can be determined by a number of factors such as:


staff availability 
visa processing times 
ATAS processing times (4-6 weeks)? 
if the applicant has already secured funding
scholarship deadlines/regulations
if the applicant has any conditions they will need to fulfil, such as do they have time to sit IELTS etc. 



Some programmes have restricted start dates; it is important that the school bears this in mind and ensures that this start date is correct.?

Change of start date
When an applicant decides that they wish to change their start date they must agree this with their school. Once agreed, the school either fills out a change of start date form?and sends to Postgraduate Research and Operations (PGRO)?via rp_applications@leeds.ac.uk or informs PGRO by email of the new start date - within this email trail should be confirmation by the Postgraduate Research Tutor that they agree to the change. PGRO cannot process verbal requests.
An amended offer letter with the new start date will then be generated and sent out to the student (a copy will be sent to the school).
If the applicant originally applied over two years ago the?school should ask the applicant?to?make a new research study application form and then the?school should send a newly completed recommendation report to PGRO. 
Some programmes have restricted start dates; it is important that the school bears this in mind and ensures that this start date is correct.?"
Postgraduate researchers enrolling on taught modules,"
Postgraduate researchers can participate in taught modules, either with formal?enrolment and assessment, or?by attending part or all of the module without undergoing assessment,in addition to the research if they are useful for training and are approved by their supervisor(s).
STUDYING MODULES WITHOUT ASSESSMENT (AUDITING)
Schools may ask PGRs to attend lectures or seminars which form part of a taught module to gain background knowledge, but may not require them to complete coursework or examination towards assessment of the module. This is called auditing a module.
If this is the case, there is no requirement to return a module enrolment form. It is at the discretion of the parent school to make arrangements for the student to sit in on any lectures and seminars which may be of benefit.?
STUDYING MODULES WITH ASSESSMENT?
Modules are normally taken during the first year of full-time study or the first and second year of part-time study. The ?first commitment is to the research project so the PGR should not undertake too much additional work.
There are different processes if the PGR is on an integrated PhD and masters, normally part of a Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT).
If a PGR wants to take a taught module, a research student module enrolment form should be completed and returned to the Postgraduate Research and Operations team. The form should be authorised by both the parent school and the teaching school offering the module. Fees may be charged where modules are formally assessed.
Read the relevant guidelines (DOC).
"
References for research degree applications,"An academic reference is an overview of an applicant, provided by someone known to them, in support of their application for research degree study.
What is a reference?
The academic reference should highlight their academic history, standard of work, potential for research degree study and any other information in support of their application, including communication skills, their ability to work as part of a team or independently, originality of work and analytical skills.?
When should I complete the reference?
We require two references when considering both the research degree study application and the scholarship application, alongside academic qualifications and supporting statement. Therefore it is important to complete a reference as quickly as possible (normally within two working weeks), and with a sufficient level of detail regarding the applicant. Scholarship competitions often have strict deadlines, and applicants may have a scholarship application automatically rejected if either reference has not been received. It may therefore sometimes be necessary to request that a reference is returned in less than two weeks.?
How do I complete the reference?
Using the template provided for Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, or Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics please provide as much information as possible against the criteria provided. Provide examples where possible, this could include examples of marks and ranking (where known) and / or quality of written work.
What makes a good reference?
The competitive nature of scholarship funding means that applicants normally have a similar level of academic achievement, therefore it is important to demonstrate additional skills attained during study. Where known it is also an opportunity to note any additional activities in support of their application, such as conference attendance, papers/journals/articles, academic prizes won, mentoring/teaching, involvement in student government / university community, organisation of conferences and meetings, community involvement or civic engagement.
How should I send the reference?
References should be sent as an email attachment from an institutional or professional email account. Please do not send a reference from a personal email address.?
Hard copy (paper) references can be accepted but must be printed on official letterhead paper, be stamped by the institution / organization of the referee and have a signature in black ink. Paper references can be sent to the School where the applicant wishes to study. As references are an essential part of the scholarship application process please do send paper references well in advance of any provided deadline.?
What is the difference between an academic reference and a professional reference?
An academic reference is written by a former/current mentor/supervisor/lecturer addressing the academic potential of an applicant.
A professional reference is the same, but relates to a period of employment rather than education. It may be necessary for an applicant to request professional references if they have completed study more than 6 years before their application for research degree study.?
A professional reference should address the same academic potential criteria, and therefore should be completed by a manager or supervisor. Professional references will not be accepted from colleagues of the applicant.?"
Research postgraduate admissions policy,"The PGR admissions policy applies to recruitment and admissions to all our postgraduate research programmes.
The PGR admissions policy sets out for all interested parties the position of the University of Leeds on key matters relating to recruitment and admission to our postgraduate research courses for all applications received from the 1st September 2020 to 31 August 2021.
The University¡¯s admissions policies are consistent with Chapter B2?and Chapter B11 of the Quality Assurance Agency¡¯s?Quality Code and comply with current equality laws affecting the admission of students.

Research postgraduate applicants awaiting master's degree results ,"UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) regulations require students who have previously studied in the UK on a Tier 4 (General) student visa to demonstrate academic progression if they are going to study a further course in the UK while on a Tier 4 (General) student visa.
Overseas applicants with an October start date and yet to be awarded their master's degree
Applicants due to be awarded their master's degree in December 2018 or January 2019 starting a PhD in October 2018 cannot provide their degree certificate prior to their start date.?These applicants can instead provide formal written confirmation from their current UK sponsor that based on their performance throughout the course the sponsor (i.e. their current UK university) deems that the student is highly likely to successfully complete their course.??? 
  The new sponsor must then note on the Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) that their offer is based on this formal written confirmation. 
In the event that the student does not successfully complete the masters, the new sponsor is required to notify UKVI and withdraw sponsorship of the student. Abuse of the ability to provide formal written formal confirmation, or failing to withdraw sponsorship, may result in compliance action being taken by UKVI.
Master's completion ¨C evidence required
To enable a student to start study in October we require a document that confirms the student is highly likely to successfully complete their current programme of studies. This must conform to the following:
1. Be on University headed paper
2. Be issued by the school or central administration
3. Confirm that the student has completed all the components for the course
4. Include any provisional results
5. Include the following statement: 'I confirm that this student is highly likely to successfully complete their programme.'
6. Be signed and/or stamped
7. Include the date the qualification is due to be awarded?
Postgraduate Research and Operations will need evidence that these new students have been awarded their master's degrees in the December/January following them starting study in October.
English language
It has been agreed that the statement from the current sponsor can also be used to demonstrate that the applicant meets our English language entry requirements.?No further evidence is required centrally although the school can request additional evidence if they wish.
The offer letter will be unconditional once PGR & Operations have written confirmation from the school, but it will contain a clause to explain the requirement of evidence of the award at a later stage and that failure to provide this will result in withdrawal from the course.? ?
If the school requires a certain mark in the master's degree then the start date must be after the result is known.?
Process
Schools must make it clear on the recommendation report that they wish to accept the applicant on the basis of completion of the masters' degree.?
Home/EU applicants with an October start date and yet to be awarded their master's degree
If the school wishes to accept an applicant who does not need a visa to study in the UK for a October start date then the offer will be based on the standard minimum academic entry requirements of at least a British bachelor?2:1 (hons)?or equivalent and the completion of the master's degree.?
The school must make an academic judgement that they are happy to accept the applicant bearing in mind the risk of them failing their master's degree.?
Process
Schools must make it clear on the recommendation report that they wish to accept the applicant on the basis of the award of the bachelor's degree + completion of the master's degree.?
Master's completion ¨C evidence required
The evidence (letter or email) should confirm that the student has completed all the components for the course and be?sent by the course tutor or administrator directly to rp_applications@adm.leeds.ac.uk. 
Postgraduate Research and Operations will not make any checks in November/December.?The offer is conditional on completion of the master's, not the award.
If the school requires a certain mark in the master's degree then the start date must be after the result is known.?"
Transfers in - postgraduate researchers,"

This section applies to postgraduate researchers (PGR) who are currently registered for a research degree at another university and who wish, as a result of their supervisor moving to Leeds, to arrange a transfer to Leeds to continue with their research.?

The following regulations apply:

Applicants can only transfer their candidature to Leeds when their supervisor takes up an appointment at Leeds. 
Transfers can only take place at the point the supervisor's contract at Leeds begins. 
Transfers will only be accepted from those institutions with research degree awarding powers. 
The research studies already undertaken at the other institution may count towards the prescribed study for the research degree at Leeds. 
The?PGR must register at Leeds and pay the appropriate academic fees for their programme of study for a minimum of 12 months full-time or 24 months part-time (overtime period is in addition to this period of time). 
A PGR who has already completed more than 24 months full-time or more than 36 months part-time at the original institution would not be eligible for transfer. 
The candidate meets the standard requirements with no loss of quality to be accepted for the degree. 
The PGR is of good standing with the other institution both academically and financially. 

The applicant must complete a standard research study application form and the school must complete?the transfer-in form.
The school must provide an official document from the previous institution that verifies the details provided on the transfer-in form. A letter from central registry or equivalent is required.
If the PGR holds a scholarship, it is the school's responsibility to check if this can be transferred to Leeds. This should be checked before the school makes a recommendation that the offer of a place be made.
Full details are set out in the transfer policy and procedure document.
"
Visiting postgraduate researchers,"Schools may be approached by potential PGR visitors. To be eligible for PGR miscellaneous study the applicant must be studying a research degree elsewhere and will be visiting the University of Leeds to undertake research for this degree.
Types of visit
There are varying types of visit to the university that depend on the circumstance of the application. A visitor may also require a specific type of visa in order to enter the UK. Further information is available via Human Resources.
Fees
Unless there is a formal exchange arrangement between the University of Leeds and another university, then it is expected that PGRs visiting for over 1 month should make payment for the use of facilities.
There is a minimum standard annual fee for 12 months of study:
2020/21: ¡ê1830
This can be broken down pro-rata as follows:



?1 month
?¡ê152.50


?2 months
?¡ê305


?3 months
?¡ê457.50


?4 months
?¡ê610


?5 months
?¡ê762.50


?6 months
?¡ê915


?7 months
?¡ê1067.50


?8 months
?¡ê1220


?9 months
?¡ê1372.50


?10 months
?¡ê1525


?11 months
?¡ê1677.50



This minimum fee only covers University overheads; the school will not derive any income from this. Schools can agree to pay on behalf of the visitor using a Form 21.
If the PGR visitor will have a significant consumption of academic resources schools may charge the normal full time international fee. The definition of ¡°significant consumption of academic resource¡± may be different in various Schools but might in general include some or all of the following:
? a supervisory and advisory load upon a member(s) of the academic staff which is similar to that provided for a research degree candidate
? significant technical assistance and support
? use of laboratory facilities and consumables
? participation in advanced skills and generic training courses offered by the faculty,?ODPL or other University providers.
In addition to the academic fee, if the research of the visitor will entail specific identifiable costs for the school a 'bench fee' may be charged but the basis for this in terms of consumables, equipment and other resources should be clearly identified in any correspondence with the student/sponsor and in information for Postgraduate Research and Operations.
Visa arrangements 
International visitors will need to comply with immigration rules. These rules are on a country by country basis, to check?what the particular requirements are for different combinations of duration and nationality please visit?https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa 
Schools should be aware that some students registered at EU institutions wishing to visit the UK may be international students and the visa arrangements set out below will apply.
An international student who is coming to the UK to undertake study must normally hold either a Short-Term Study Visa (formerly Student Visitor Visa) or a Tier 4 General Student Visa. If the person already has some other form of visa they should contact the International Student Office for advice before travelling ¨C it may be that if they commence full time study on that visa, they would be in breach of their current visa regulations and not able to apply for a student visa from within the UK.
Student Visitor Letter
Students who need a Short Term Study Visa will need to apply for this with a Student Visitor Letter. This is produced and provided by the school for those international student visitors to Leeds for periods of time of six months or less. A template can be found here. You may include additional details, but do not remove any sections in the template.

Up to 1 month (International and Home/EU)
Registration as a student is not required.
When very short visits (of up to one month) take place it is not proposed that individuals should register as students of the University. It is therefore not necessary for them to complete a University application form. However, the applicant must be registered to study at a higher education institution for a research degree level qualification for at least the duration of the visit.
Visa requirements
International student visitors will require a Short-term Study Visa.
This visa status entitles the holder to remain in the UK for a period of up to six months and this CANNOT be extended. No work, paid or unpaid, is permitted.
Where a Short-term Study Visa is issued the University is NOT required to undertake Home Office Tier 4 sponsorship duties e.g. attendance monitoring or reporting on leavers/non registration.
The school will need to produce a Student Visitor Letter if the visitor is international for visa purposes.
Fees
In most cases of this kind, no fee will be due to the University. The school can make their own arrangements to charge a fee if they wish.

An overview of the process can be found here.

1 month - 6 months (International and Home/EU)

This guidance covers International applicants visiting for 1-6 months, and?Home/EU applicants visiting for any period over 1 month.

Fees 


Unless there is a formal exchange arrangement between the University of Leeds and another university, then it is expected that students should make payment for the use of facilities.


In some situations a formal reciprocal agreement will be in place with the institution where the student visitor is currently studying. In these cases any fee can be waived if there is an existence of a formal reciprocal agreement. If there is a fee waiver then this should be noted in the conditions box.


PGR & Operations should be advised of the number of months of the visit (including dates) via the Schools Recommendation Report. PGR & Operations will inform the Strategy and Planning Office for Resource Allocation Model purposes.


Process 


? Visitors must apply using the online admissions system.


The applicant must be registered to study at a higher education institution for a research degree level qualification for at least the duration of the visit.


? Schools must check and complete the school section of the Schools Recommendation Report. It should then be sent to PGRO.


In the conditions box it should state: 


a) the number of months (including dates) that the visitor will be studying for, and 


b) what fee is to be charged. 


? International applicants studying with a school that comes under the Foreign and Commonwealth Office ATAS scheme will require ATAS clearance and the school must provide PGR & Operations with the relevant 'Initial Proposed Summary of Research Area Letter' alongside the School Recommendation Report. 


? PGR & Operations update the Banner record and inform Student Finance (Fees) of the fee details. Student Finance (Fees) will amend Banner. Where a fee is payable it should be noted that the student will not be able to register until this fee is paid in full.


? The University (PGR & Operations) will, assuming no problems with the application, issue an unconditional acceptance letter containing the details of the offer. (If applicable the ATAS statement will also be included with the offer letter.)


? Applicants accept as normal.


? The school will issue their usual communications and instructions to the visitor.


Schools must produce a Student Visitor Letter for International Students to use in a visa application. 


? A Registration Report will be produced by PGR & Operations as normal and sent to the school at the point that the person is eligible to register as a student. This report is for information only. If any form 21s are required then they should be sent to the Fees Office before informing the student that they can register.


? The visitor can then register as a miscellaneous research non-degree (non-award bearing) student via the normal on-line registration system route and obtain a student ID card.

An overview of the process can be found here.
+6 months (International)
These visitors will?register as students.
Visa requirements
International student visitors will require a Tier 4 General Student Visa.
In order for the applicant to apply for a General Student Visa then the University must issue a CAS to the applicant. This means the applicant must demonstrate that they meet University academic and English language requirements and must be eligible to hold an unconditional offer. They will also need to apply for ATAS clearance if relevant.
PGRO will issue a formal offer letter.
Fees
Unless there is a formal exchange arrangement between the University of Leeds and another university, then it is expected that students should make payment for the use of facilities.
In some situations a formal reciprocal agreement will be in place with the institution where the student visitor is currently studying. In these cases any fee can be waived if there is an existence of a formal reciprocal agreement. If there is a fee waiver then this should be noted in the conditions box
PGR & Operations should be advised of the number of months of the visit (including dates) via the Schools Recommendation Report. PGR & Operations will inform the Strategy and Planning Office for Resource Allocation Model purposes.
Process
? Visitors must apply online.
Applicant must be registered to study at a higher education institution for a research degree level qualification for at least the duration of the visit. Additionally, for a Tier 4 student visas, the applicant must be enrolled on a course that is at least equivalent to the level of a UK bachelor¡¯s degree.
? International applicants requiring a CAS must demonstrate:
1.?English language ¨C all Tier 4 sponsors must assess their Tier 4 (General) students¡¯ level of English language competence. This means the applicant must have met the required standards by:
2.?Academic evidence ¨C highest awarded qualification to date.
? Schools must check and complete the school section of the Schools Recommendation Report. It should then be sent to PGRO.
In the conditions box it should state: 
a) the number of months (including dates) that the visitor will be studying for, and 
b) what fee is to be charged.
? International applicants studying with a school that comes under the Foreign and Commonwealth Office ATAS scheme will require ATAS clearance and the school must provide PGR & Operations with the relevant 'Initial Proposed Summary of Research Area Letter' alongside the School Recommendation Report.
? PGR & Operations update the Banner record and inform Student Finance (Fees) of the fee details Student Finance (Fees) will amend Banner. Where a fee is payable it should be noted that the student will not be able to register until this fee is paid in full.
? The University (PGRO) will, assuming no problems with the application, issue an unconditional acceptance letter containing the details of the offer. (If applicable the ATAS statement will also be included with the offer letter.)
? Applicants accept as normal.
? For international students, PGRO need the School Recommendation, evidence of English language, academic evidence and, if relevant, ATAS summary of research area, before an offer can be made/CAS issued. The University does not issue conditional offers to these applicants.
? PGR & Operations will issue a Confirmation of Acceptance for Study (CAS) Statement to the applicant that contains the CAS number, University Sponsor Licence number and details of the fee to be charged where appropriate. This will enable the student to apply for a Tier 4 General Student Visa.
The CAS has a life span of 6 months but can only be used up to 3 months prior to the start date. Therefore PGR & Operations will issue the CAS when appropriate.
? On arrival, individuals must register via the online registration system as miscellaneous non-degree (non-award bearing) students and obtain a student ID card. The University will also need to take a copy of relevant passport and visa information.
An overview of the process can be found here.
Attendance monitoring for international Students
For international students on a Tier 4 visa, the University is required to undertake Tier 4 sponsorship duties. This means the University has responsibility for reporting non-registration, unauthorised non-attendance and apparent leavers and monitoring the attendance of these individuals.
Schools must have arrangements in place for monitoring attendance and for reporting non-attendance to Postgraduate Research and Operations.
Examples of attendance monitoring events at research level are:
? Formal supervision meetings with supervisor
? School activities associated with registration and other routine communication
? Induction and training courses
? Meeting with supervisor to discuss and review any training plan
??ODPL courses and faculty training (including research seminars involving giving presentations)
? Formal review meetings
? Meetings with Postgraduate Research Tutor or other relevant staff
? Attendance at external conference/meetings
? Other events at school level
It is recognised that there are different events and timelines within different schools, reflecting the varying nature of research study. Schools may already have their own practices that relate to these events.
Therefore as a minimum, schools will be required to put the following procedure in place:
i) Supervisors (or other relevant staff) will be required to report to the school/faculty when there has been no contact with individual research students within any 1 month period (unless absence has been authorised for events such as fieldwork, illness, etc.), or where there is a pattern of absences that is affecting the student¡¯s work or causing concerns for the student¡¯s wellbeing.
ii) An investigation should then be carried out within the school that will provide an opportunity for issues to be resolved with the student.
iii) Where issues are not resolved, a full report will be sent by the faculty/school to PGR & Operations indicating that the student should be required to withdraw from the University.
iv) PGR & Operations will carry out any other appropriate enquiries and then, after further review, notify the Home Office of withdrawal.



Holding a degree from a majority English speaking country
Being a national of a majority English language speaking country
Having obtained the relevant standards in IELTS or equivalent (see?the English Language booklet).?

GRAD,"Learn about and log in to our standard system for recording postgraduate researchers progress including how to get started and FAQs.
The Graduate Record of Achievement and Development (GRAD) is the University record keeping system for all Postgraduate Researchers:
https://research.leeds.ac.uk/
All postgraduate researchers (PGRs) and supervisors can now use the system to organise, manage and report on:


supervision meetings


first formal progress review


transfer?

annual progress reviews 
create a training plan? 
manage change requests (including annual leave, authorised absence and change of location). 

Please note that if you have previously been using the PDR this has now been changed to a ¡®read only¡¯ format. Rest assured that none of your information or data will be lost. However, you cannot now add to your records in the PDR, nor can you use it to arrange meetings. Within your personal GRAD record, you will find a link that will take you directly to your personal PDR page; this should make it easy to move between the two systems in this initial transitional period. However, GRAD must now be used for all PGR record-keeping
Guides and support 
User guides explaining how to use GRAD are available on the system (select 'Guides' from the left-hand menu in GRAD). If you have any problems using the system, please contact your Graduate School Administrator.? 
FAQS




Q1:? In cases where the PGR has not completed their section of the FFPR but the supervisor has started and then completed their part of the process in GRAD. The PGR is now unable to complete their part of the FFPR? What do we do?



1.? PGRO has requested that the ability for supervisors to start the FFPR process be switched off in GRAD. So, in the longer term this should not be?an issue. 
          2.? We would suggest that the PGR use the ""Add on a follow on note"" functionality to record their part of the process.? The PGR should go into GRAD and open the FFPR. On the right hand side of the screen is the option to Add on a follow on note and there is an upload function for them to upload a word copy of the completed FFPR form. 
3.? There is currently no automated email in GRAD to the supervisor to alert them to the added note. So the PGR will need to email their supervisor outside of GRAD to let them know this has been added. 
4.? The supervisor can the select the completed FFPR for the PGR in GRAD?and view the follow on note and any attachment. 
5.? The supervisor can, if necessary, add a follow on note themselves. Again they would need to email the PGR to let them know a note has been added.



Q2:? The PGR has submitted their FFPR/APR and it is now with the supervisor. The PGR now realises that they have made an error and needs to amend their report. What do we do? 


The supervisor will have the option to return the report to the PGR. 
          To do this they should go into GRAD select the relevant task (or click on the link in the email) and then on the right hand side of the page they will see the option to ¡°return report¡± (orange button) 



Q3:? The main supervisor has drafted the FFPR and wishes to seek comments from the co-supervisor. How do we do this? 


?(a) The main supervisor could agree changes to the report outside of GRAD. ? 
          ?(b) The main supervisor should complete their draft of the report and ¡°save for later¡±. On the right hand side menu they will have the option to delegate this task (grey button). ?If they click on this button the name of the co-supervisor or co-supervisors will appear. They should select the relevant individual to delegate to. The co-supervisor will then receive an email notification and the task. 
The co-supervisor can view the draft report and edit as necessary. They can then either ¡°save for later¡± and delegate back to the main supervisor or ¡°save¡± and submit the FFPR as complete. 



Q4:? There is an option for the supervisor to raise concerns with the PGRT ¨C what does this do? 



The supervisor should complete this section if they have concerns with the PGR¡¯s progress which they believe need to be drawn to the attention of the PGRT.?This will generate an email to the PGRT and PGR Admin and will be recorded in the records with a concerns raised flag. 



Q5:? I am the PGRT and have received a notification that the supervisor has raised concerns about the PGR¡¯s progress. What do I do? 



You should review the comments raised by the supervisor in the relevant workflow in GRAD (eg supervision meeting notes, FFPR, APR). Any action required will depend on the individual circumstances. ?As PGRT and PGRA you have the option to add a ¡°follow on note¡± against the relevant workflow in GRAD. You can use this record any follow up action taken outside of GRAD. 



?Q6:? I am a supervisor and when I log into GRAD I cannot see any PGRs that I am supervisor for. What do I do?


?Raise this via the IT Helpdesk 


?Q7:? I am a supervisor?and in GRAD I?can see some PGRs but not all. What do I do?


?Raise this with your Graduate School Administrator 


?Q8:? I am the PGR Tutor - how do I find a list of PGRs that I am PGRT for? 



Select ¡°Graduate School¡± to access a number of dashboards.?The ¡°Current Postgraduate Researchers¡± dashboards includes all PGRs for your School/Faculty. The ¡°PGRT Assignment¡± Dashboard shows which PGRs each PGRT is assigned to 



?Q9:? I am the PGR Tutor but I am not listed as PGRT for the correct PGRs/ The PGRT listing is incorrect. What do I do?



?Raise this with your Graduate School Administrator 




Q10:? ?I am the PGR Tutor and I have received a task as PGRT?for a PGR I am also the supervisor for. What do I do?



You can delegate the task to one of the other PGRTs (grey button). You should also Raise this with your Graduate School Administrator so that the PGRT assignment can be changed in GRAD 


Q11: I am the Chair of a Transfer Panel. I have drafted the Joint Transfer Report. How do I share this with other Panel members for comment?



The recommended best practice is to complete the?transfer report immediately after the?viva whilst all members of the Panel are still present.
If this is not possible the following instructions may be helpful. After you have drafted the report you should select save for later. Outside of GRAD you can email the other Panel members to let them know the draft report is available to view in GRAD and invite comments.? The other Panel members will have the option to view the draft report in GRAD?(but not edit it) in the transfer workflow for the relevant PGR. They will need to forward comments on the draft to you outside of GRAD.? The Panel Chair can then edit the report to include any comments before saving and submitting it.







Q12:?? Advisors ¨C How can I attach them to a PGR¡¯s record and what will they be able to see and do in GRAD? 



Advisors are not recorded in BANNER so will not feed through to GRAD.? However, any Advisors added in the PDR should have been?transferred to GRAD when the PDR data was extracted on 21 March. 
The PGRA can add?(or remove) an Advisor?to an individual?PGR's record using the edit function?at the top of the PGR¡¯s project page in their GRAD record.?? 
Advisors have view only access to GRAD for the individual PGR concerned.?? They cannot edit supervision meetings or other GRAD records as this functionality is for supervisors only.? If the Advisor has written notes of a meeting they should forward these to the PGRA so that?the PGRA?can upload them to the GRAD record using the Project Files functionality (against Advisor meeting notes). 



Q13:? The First Formal Progress Report is (i) not visible to the PGR so they cannot start the process or (ii) the First Formal Progress Report date is incorrect for an Integrated PhD and Masters PGR or a 4 year PhD programme.? What do I do? 


GRAD automatically populates the FFPR due date (6 months from the date of commencement for a full-time PGR or 9 months for part-time PGR). The FFPR will be available for the PGR to start for up to 6 months post the due date.??Once a PGR is 6 months beyond the due date the option to start the FFPR will no longer be visible. 
          We understand that this GRAD generated date will not be appropriate for Integrated PhD and Master and some 4 year PhD programmes.??? 
In both of the above two cases the PGRA can edit the completion date for the FFPR in GRAD using Project Dates.? Please edit the FFPR ¡°completion¡± date to do this.? Once this is edited the new date will show in GRAD and the option to complete the FFPR will re-appear and be available for 6 months from the new completion date.




Q14: Can an external supervisor access GRAD?



External supervisors will be able to access GRAD (view only) shortly. This is being worked on at the moment. GRAD (view-only) access may not be required by external supervisors in all cases and is not a University requirement. We will inform Schools of the process to be followed as soon as this is available in the live system. In all cases where an external supervisor is appointed the School must continue inform PGRO of their details. PGRO will arrange for the nomination to be considered and approved on behalf of the PSAG and then create the external supervisor in Banner and attach them to the PGR¡¯s record. If GRAD access is also required, the external supervisor will require an IT username to access the GRAD system. Therefore (if they have not already done so) the external supervisor should be advised to apply for a University IT username and password which will allow them to access GRAD once the functionality is available. The link to apply for a username is: http://username.leeds.ac.uk. The external supervisor should be advised they will need to complete the Category section of the form as visitor/contractor.? Once the application has been verified the School will need to inform PGRO of the external supervisor¡¯s username and email address. 



Q15:?? A PGR or Supervisor has started a Meeting Request in error/or the meeting did not take place.? What should they do? 



Either the PGR or Supervisor can confirm the ¡°Meeting Did not Take Place¡± by clicking on the orange button in the relevant supervision meeting (they are then asked to confirm they would like to mark this meeting as having not taken place).??? When this action is taken the meeting will no longer show on the supervision or visa monitoring dashboards.?? It is good practice for the PGR or Supervisor to record in the ¡°Add on Notes¡±? a brief note eg the meeting was set up in error.



Q16:?? A PGR (or supervisor) wishes to delete an entry in the First Formal Progress Report, Annual Progress Review, Transfer etc.? What should they do? 





When a PGR (or supervisor) feels there is a need to delete/hide an entry in GRAD that they have added in error they should contact their Faculty/School PGR administrator in the first instance. 
The Faculty/School can then assess the legitimacy of the request.?? 
If the PGR administrator agrees that the request is legitimate, they should submit a request to the IT service desk on behalf of the PGR (supervisor) with clear instructions for the item to be removed from view (e.g. screen shot/web link) together with reasons for the request. 
The IT Service Desk will consult with PGRO to seek confirmation that the item can be removed from view before taking any action. 
This process ensures a clear audit trail is retained 




"
Progress and monitoring - postgraduate researchers,"PGRs and supervisors should meet regularly and records must be kept of all formal supervision meetings. Formal reports are also needed at key points during the research degree.
All PGRs and their supervisors can now use?the?Graduate Record of Achievement and Development (GRAD) system to organise and report on supervision meetings, to create a training plan, to organise and record all regular progress monitoring meetings (first formal progress review, transfer, and annual progress reviews), and to manage ¡®change requests¡¯ including annual leave, authorised absence and change of location.
Supervision meetings and guidance for the PGR
There should be at least ten formal supervision meetings per year for full time PGRs, in line with the Code of practice on research degree candidatures?(the equivalent for part-time?PGRs is?six meetings).??
Regular meetings should be held to ensure that the?PGR receives regular advice and guidance.
Each?PGR should be offered the opportunity to meet annually with the postgraduate research tutor or head of school to review progress, without the supervisor. This gives the?PGR an opportunity to comment on the supervision they've received and to raise any matters of concern.
Records of supervision meetings must be held in the?Graduate Record of Achievement and Development (GRAD) system.
Progress reports
The minimum requirements for progress reporting?are given below.?All the following progress reports must be completed using the forms in the?Graduate Record of Achievement and Development (GRAD) system.
Full time PGRs
Reports should be made in GRAD as follows:

at 6 months?
at the transfer stage?(between 9 and 12 months to be reviewed at the transfer)
annually thereafter,?including any overtime year

Part time PGRs
Reports should be made in GRAD as follows:

at 9 months
at the transfer stage (between 18 and 24 months to reviewed at the transfer)
annually thereafter, including during any overtime years

The?PGR should always receive clear written information about the assessment of progress.
If the supervisor considers that the PGR's progress is unsatisfactory, they may consider starting the Unsatisfactory academic progress procedure. The procedure document sets out all the steps that should be taken including consultation with the postgraduate research tutor. Supervisors are encouraged to refer to the procedure as soon as they have any concerns.
First Formal Progress Report
PGRs?will be expected to complete a review of their progress before the completion of six months of full-time study (or 9 months for part-time). There will be an opportunity to comment on any issues which may have adversely affected their progress.?The supervisor will then provide an assessment of?their overall progress, progress against?the training plan and comment on English language written and communication skills.
Transfer
All doctoral PGRs are initially registered as provisional doctoral?candidates and are therefore subject to a formal transfer assessment process within a specified timescale. ?If successful in this assessment, the PGR is then transferred to doctoral study.?
As part of the submission for transfer?the PGR?will be expected to complete a review of?their progress and offered the opportunity to comment on any issues which may have adversely affected their progress. Prior to the transfer assessment?the supervisor will complete a report on their progress. The report will include an assessment of?progress, progress against the training plan and comment on English language written and communication skills in addition to ethical and data storage requirements.
Annual Progress Review (Post-Transfer)
This will be completed for all PGRs including MPhil and part-time Masters by research. Progress will be monitored annually on or before the anniversary of the start date until submission of the thesis.?
There are two models for annual progress review meetings:
Model A: a meeting with the?PGR conducted by the supervisor together with an individual independent of the supervisory team (adopted by FBS, Engineering, MAPS and Medicine and Health)
OR
Model B: a meeting between the?PGR and the supervisor. The report of the meeting will be reviewed by a committee within the faculty/school (adopted by Arts, Business, Environment, Social Sciences and PVAC)
The?PGR will submit the following in advance of the meeting:

reflection on progress to date (with the opportunity to highlight issues which have had a negative impact on progress)
timetable for completion (eg Gantt chart)
written work as required by the faculty/supervisor

Transfer to doctoral study,"To progress?to doctoral study PGRs must pass transfer
All PGRs studying for a doctoral award?will initially register for either provisional doctoral study.?
They will be required to undertake a formal transfer assessment within a specified timescale.? If successful in this assessment, they will be transferred to doctoral study.
The transfer assessment is intended to identify:

whether the PGR and their project have the potential for research at doctoral level
whether it is achievable for the PGR to complete their thesis within the standard period of study for their programme

"
What are the catalogues?,"The University of Leeds publishes its taught curriculum on web pages called the programme and module catalogues.?
Catalogue web pages
 

Undergraduate Module Catalogue
Undergraduate?Programme Catalogue
Postgraduate?Module Catalogue
Postgraduate?Programme Catalogue

 
 The curricular information that is published on the web catalogues is
the ¡°true record¡± of our programme and module specifications. Therefore, it is
crucial to ensure that this information is kept accurate and up-to-date.
These web pages also
provide a historical record of what had been taught at a particular time. For
example, the 2016/17 programme catalogue entry for BA English displays the
programme structure for each level of this degree programme in 2016/17. 
Backend content management system
The curricular
information is held on two backend content management systems: the module
catalogue & the programme catalogue. These use Banner functionality, but
the information is held in a separate database. As some curricular information
is stored in the actual Banner database, it is crucial for data quality to
ensure that the two sources of information are kept correct. 
Systems the catalogue impacts
 
TimetablingThe
catalogues have impact on the timetabling system, as the specification of the
module¡¯s maximum class size is used by the timetabling team when allocating
rooms for taught activities. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
Coursefinder
The University has an external-facing ¡°Coursefinder¡± system that prospective
students can use to find degree programmes they are interested in studying.
Information about programme content on this page pulls directly from the
programme catalogue. 
Online module enrolment
Current students enrol on their module choices online. The structure of their
programme and the available optional modules guide the choices that students can make in this system. This structure is written and maintained in the programme catalogue. 
As module enrolment
operates on a ¡°first-come, first-served¡± basis, getting data quality in the
catalogues right is crucially important. Failing to do so can have significant
negative impact on the student experience. "
Catalogue publication dates,"The Programme and Module Catalogue webpages are published on a set date each year, in advance of the?upcoming academic term.
The publication date takes place after the University¡¯s?annual curriculum approval process and associated deadlines, and in advance of online module enrolment opening?for returning undergraduate students in the summer.
The catalogue publication date for the academic term 2022/23, whereby confirmed module and programme content approved for the upcoming academic term will be displayed online, is 01 May?2022 (or nearest working day after this date).
The catalogue publication date for the academic term 2023/24? is?to be confirmed.
"
Catalogue contacts,"Details of key contact information for the catalogues are held on this page.
Programmes and Assessment (Curriculum and Timetabling)
The Curriculum?Team, who offer training, guidance and advice on matters relating to the catalogues,?sit within Programmes and Assessment (Curriculum and?Timetabling).?
Please contact the Curriculum Team?with any queries you have by emailing catalogue@leeds.ac.uk.
School contacts
Each school has a dedicated catalogue co-ordinator. These are viewable on the web catalogue if you access the School¡¯s page using the drop down menus. The school's contact's details are viewable on a card at the top of their school¡¯s catalogue page.
This contact will be able to discuss any catalogue issues with regards to their school¡¯s curriculum.
?
"
Catalogue training links,"?This page contains information about organising training for the catalogues.
IT training for module and programme catalogues
The IT training team run group training sessions for the module and programme catalogues throughout the year. Look on the Courses and Workshops search page for details of when the next training session will be. 
One-to-one training
Programmes & Assessment?(Curriculum & Timetabling) can provide one-to-one training on the module and programme catalogues if there is a particular training need. This can be done for staff with no prior catalogue experience, or as a refresher session for existing catalogue users. Email?catalogue@leeds.ac.uk to organise a session. 
How access is granted
After a user?has?successfully undertaken Catalogue training?the IT Banner Security team will assign permissions for the Banner pages SWAPCAT and SWAMCAT. They will then notify Programmes & Assessment?(Curriculum & Timetabling), who will assign specific School/Department-based editing permissions, enabling the user?to edit programme and module records for?the School(s) that they work in.?
"
Student handbooks,"The Taught Student Handbook Framework?is?intended to provide a structure on which to base School or Faculty Taught Student Handbooks and was developed by a sub-group of the Programme Support Management Team in 2019 for adoption across the University, and is updated annually.?
The following link contains guidance for using the Taught Student Handbook Framework. Please read and adhere to the guidance when setting up your School or Faculty Taught Student Handbook using the Taught Student Handbook Framework.?

Communicating with students and postgraduate researchers.,"This page tells you about the central channels we use to communicate university-wide messages and how we can support you in reaching your audience.??
Students get their information from a variety of different sources, including websites, different social media channels, emails, newsletters, staff and other students!
The Student Communication and Engagement team communicates to all taught students. As such, the messages are broad and often quite general. If you are looking to reach smaller groups of students then we recommend speaking to us for advice and further contacts.
As well as providing advice, we may be able to help amplify your communications by:

Retweeting your tweets ¨C?tag @UoLStudents and we¡¯ll retweet, if possible.
Including a brief summary of your news, campaign or event in our student newsletter, if appropriate.
Providing you with guidance and contacts to make sure that staff know about your content ¨C?if appropriate.?
Suggesting additional further ways of reaching current students, including paid for?promoted social media adverts, display screens across campus, or speaking to school or service communication colleagues.

Student newsletter
Last year we asked students what they liked about our newsletter and how we can improve it. They told us the content was useful and relevant but the look of the newsletter can be improved. As a result, we¡¯ve introduced a new look for the newsletter that looks allows us to provide clear and concise updates that are accessible across difference devices and provde us with analytics that will help us continue to make improvements.?
We currently plan to send the newsletter every two weeks on a Friday. Note, this may change if there are reasons to send additional ones.
The next few dates for the newsletter to be sent are:

Friday 25 February
Friday 11 March
Friday 25 March
Friday 11 April
Friday 25 April

Submit your content using the submission form by the Monday of newsletter week. Note we may need to edit this to fit the style, space and theme of the newsletter, and there may be times when your submission isn¡¯t able to be published.
If you have any questions or need to get a message out to students urgently, please email the Student Communications and Engagement team: studentcommunications@leeds.ac.uk
"
Ad personam and ad hoc programme variation processes,"Ad personam or ad hoc programme variations must be approved by the relevant Pro-Dean for Student Education, acting on behalf of the Faculty Taught Student Education Committee.
The processes you need to go through to make ad personam and ad hoc programme variations are outlined here.
Making a case: programme learning outcomes
For both ad personam and ad hoc programme variation, the proposing school should set out how:

the proposed revised programme will be structured
the revised structure will allow the student(s) to meet the programme learning outcomes.

Note: It is particularly important that any waiver or change to compulsory modules is justified in relation to the programme learning outcomes.
Ad personam programmes for individual students
A school proposes an ad personam programme variation through the Exams team.
Use the Request for ad personam programme variation approval form. Email this to: examinationsconf@leeds.ac.uk.
The Exams team will seek approval from the relevant Pro-Dean for Student Education. If the request is approved, the Programmes and Assessment team will make the necessary changes directly in the student record within Banner.
Note: an ad personam programme is approved for the named student only. To use it for other students, you must get permission again from the Faculty Taught Student Education Committee (FTSEC).
Ad hoc changes to a programme
A school proposes an ad hoc programme variation through the Quality Assurance team (QAT).
?
Use Part B of the?apppropriate programme proposal form (undergraduate or?postgraduate) to provide details of the new ad hoc programme variation, see programme proposal forms. QAT will then seek approval from the relevant Pro-Dean/FTSEC.
When the changes have been approved, you need to make them in the programme catalogue entry, so they are implemented for all students in the cohort.
An ad hoc programme will be approved for a specified cohort of students only. To use it for subsequent cohorts, you must again get approval from the Pro-Dean/FTSEC.
Schools must:

Complete full documentation for the ad hoc programme, including specifying the rules for eligibility for awards where these differ from the normal arrangements.
Ensure that the proposed modules comprise a coherent and logical choice, consistent with the intended programme learning outcomes.
Check the acceptability of the arrangement with all participating schools and any external partners.
Clear any practical difficulties, such as normal pre-requisites, which might have to be set aside.
Discuss, where appropriate, the proposed ad hoc arrangements with the relevant external examiner(s) and keep a record of such discussions

"
Funding for disabled students,"The main source of funding for disabled students from the UK is the Disabled Students' Allowance. ?
?
Disabled Students' Allowances (DSA)
DSA is funding provided to disabled students to assist with disability-related costs resulting from their programme of study and allowing them to participate fully. It is not means tested and does not need to be repaid.?Students receiving equipment through their DSA are allowed to keep that equipment when their programme has ended.
Most UK students are eligible to apply. Prospective students will have their specific needs assessed and will receive a needs assessment report.
For most students, DSA is provided by the government through Student Finance England. Students on healthcare courses will need to apply through the NHS.
Postgraduate research students who are funded by one of the Research Councils can apply for DSA. Further information is available on the Research Councils UK (RCUK) website.
Applying for DSA
The way in which students apply for and are assessed for funding differs between funding sources, as does the process for invoicing and reclaiming the cost of support.
The funding application process can take three months so applicants should be encouraged to apply as soon as possible. They do not have to have a confirmed place on a programme at the University.?
DSA provided by Student Finance England
Applicants for funding should follow the up to date guidance provided on the British Government website.?
?
?
?
DSA provided by the NHS?
Applicants to healthcare programmes should apply for DSA as part of their student bursary application. Up to date guidance and an online application system are provided on the NHS Business Services Authority website.?



DSA provided by Research Councils UK (RCUK)
Students funded by a Research Council should discuss their disability-related funding with a Disability Coordinator. Claims are submitted ona a proforma via graduate schools to the Postgraduate Scholarships Office, who are responsible for submitting applications to research councils. The deadline for submission is mid-October each year. Further information is available on the?Research Councils UK (RCUK) website.
What level of funding is available through DSA?

Funding will vary according to the results of each applicant's assessment of need, up to maximum levels which are available on the government website. These are reviewed regularly.
For undergraduate students funding is divided into allowances for specialist equipment, non-medical helpers and a general allowance.
For postgraduate students who have recently had equipment funded through DSA for an undergraduate programme, this may be deemed sufficient for further study.
Other sources of funding

Disability Services will work with students to find further sources of funding for students who either are not eligible for any of the DSA schemes or whose DSA funding does not cover the support that they need.
Encourage students to contact DSAS as soon as possible.?
Students who exceed their DSA will still receive support during their studies at Leeds.

"
Tuition fee Scholarships and awards ,"University departments?may make tuition fee awards to students, for example?the alumni bursary or as part of a postgraduate research scholarship.?To do this, departments should use a FA1?form. Guidance on how to complete a form is below.
Forms
?

FA1 Form ¨C can be used to authorise and notify Student Fees of fee scholarships
Fee Amendment Form ¨C used to notify Student Fees of an amendment to an existing student fee award
Fee Reversal form ¨C used to notify Student Fees of the need to completely reverse a fee scholarship?

Guidance documentation
?

Guidance document ¨C this is a detailed overview of how to complete the forms, where to send them, and how to request an amendment to an award.

Process Overview: Notifying Student Fees?
?

Individual in the School or Service completes a FA1 form
An Authorised Signatory emails the form directly to FA1@leeds.ac.uk (not cc-ed or bcc-ed).
If all necessary information has been provided and sent by an Authorised Signatory, Student Fees will enter the award on the Banner system.??

?
Student Fees can only accept the approved version of the FA1, Payment Amendment, and Reversal forms due to specific formatting requirements (available above). Any old versions of the form cannot be processed and therefore payments will not be made. Any forms submitted by an unauthorised Signatory cannot be processed.?
Forms, What to Use and How (the Dos and Don'ts)?
Please note that the FA1 form uses macros to facilitate some of the built in functionality and?it is important that once you have finished using the FA1 form you completely close down Excel before continuing on with other work. If you do not completely close Excel?there can be issues with certain action (such as copy and pasting) that occur as a result of the Visual Basic for?Applications (VBA) programme continuing to run in the background.
We have aimed to keep complexity to a minimum however, if you have any issues inputting information on a form, please contact Student Fees and we will be happy to provide you with extra information or training.
Please check carefully that the SID and Surname has been entered correctly before sending. Note, the first name is not required for GDPR compliance.
Is the student eligible for a scholarship? The Fees team do not audit eligibility. For example, if the scholarship is only valid for alumni or self-funding students you must check this before completing the form.
Has the student been informed? Student fees do not contact students to say an award has been added to the system, you must notify the student to ensure they know about any scholarships.
Please send the completed form directly to FA1@leeds.ac.uk (not cc-ed or bcc-ed).
Please do:
?

Check that the Cost Object Number quoted is in a valid format
Check that the Student ID number(s) quoted match the student listed
Only use one cost object/account number per FA1 form. This will greatly help the student fees team when inputting and reduce input errors.
Use a separate form for different academic years or different amounts. This will lessen inputting errors and speed up processing.
Preserve the formatting of the form, especially when pasting in data. The font size must be legible in order for Student Fees to be able to process the payment request.
Complete the relevant Payment Amendment Form for an amendment to an award that does not result in the student receiving increased money or a total reversal of the award.
Complete a Reversal Form where you require the total award to be completely reversed and not just amended.
Make sure that the correct academic year is used. If a form is input to the wrong year, the student may not be able to complete registration.?
Select the correct GL code for the award:

- 56041 for Alumni Bursary only
- 56042 for Fee waivers (for example, a reduction for mitigating circumstances)
- 56040 for all other awards
?

Select the correct Major Source of Funding code. This is always a two digit code. This is so that we can report scholarship information to HESA, it is essential for processing the form. A list of all the Major Source of Funding codes is provided here.
In order to increase an existing award to a student, please send another form for the extra amount only ¨C not for the new overall award total. The amendment form should be sent from an authorised signatory to FA1@leeds.ac.uk
Check that your Authorised Signatory List is up-to-date.
Check that there is enough budget in the account/cost object to cover the award payment.

Please do:
?

Not send replacement/duplicate forms, or forms which supersede previously submitted forms. In the event of a duplicate form being sent, Student fees accept no responsibility for duplicate forms being processed.
Not use the FA1 form to pay for work performed by the recipient for or on behalf of the University of Leeds. If you wish to make a payment directly to the student as an award or maintenance, use the MA1 form. These are processed by the Funding team.
Not add extra students to a form that has already been submitted. Please create a new form
Not alter the form from a landscape set up to portrait as this will affect the ability to input data.
Not leave mandatory fields blank.
Not scan the forms and send them as pdf attachments.
Not send reformat or change any part of the FA1 form.
Not re-send forms to FA1@leeds.ac.uk in order to query them. Any forms sent to this e-mail address are liable to be paid, so re-sending forms could result in a duplicate payment being made. Any queries should be sent to FA1queries@leeds.ac.uk

Changes to Awards/Querying Awards
If a payment needs to be altered, please email a completed Payment Amendment Form to FA1@leeds.ac.uk
If you have any queries regarding the processing of a payment, please contact Student Fees directly for further information.
When to Send an FA1 Form?
Student Fees receive in excess of 5,000 forms each year, mainly during our peak registration period in September. With this in mind, it would be very helpful if FA1¡¯s are sent in advance to ensure processing before registration (but after the general student record has been created in Banner).
Regardless of when the FA1 is processed your account will not be debited until the student completes online registration.
The award must not constitute a refund of an overpayment of accommodation or tuition fee payments made by the student to the University. The student should contact the Fees office directly to discuss the overpayment.
Processing Turnaround
Forms that are correctly completed and authorised will be processed within three working days of receipt. Please note that this may extend to five working days during busy periods.
If forms are completed incorrectly or budgets are exceeded, processing will be delayed and will be three working days from when the issue is resolved. This may require a new FA1 form being submitted with new authorisation.
Retention of FA1 forms
Copies of all FA1 forms should be retained by Schools/Faculties for the statutory retention period. FA1 forms will be retained by Student Fees for two years.

Students receiving an award need to supply their bank account details via the secure University Portal.
Registration status of the student:
Usually the University of Leeds will only process payments to registered students (Banner codes: RE or RO). An award will not be paid via the standard process whenever a student:

hasn't registered (Banner codes: EL, EN, ER, NR, NS)
has withdrawn (Banner codes: WD WA NA)
is under examination (Banner codes: UE) (see note below).
has suspended (Banner codes: CS, SF, SP)
is external (Banner codes EF, EP)


Please be aware that you will need to ensure that you identify on the MA1 form if you wish to pay a student an award where their status is anything other than RE/RO. There is a specific field on the MA1 form for this purpose. If a student¡¯s status changes after you have notified the funding team of an award then payments will be made in these situations if the individual case is agreed via email with a member of Funding, with an authorised signatory copied in.
Where the student is not RE/RO and no extra arrangement is made, overdue instalments remain pending on their file. If the student does later become RE/RO for the academic year of their award, overdue instalments will be processed to reach the bank account as a single sum in the following payment cycle.
Payments over multiple academic years:
To request an award outside the student¡¯s academic year, typically two MA1 forms need to be raised. The first to pay x number of instalments, taking the award to the start of the student¡¯s academic year. The second to pay the balance of the award over the remaining months.
Retention of MA1 Forms

Copies of all MA1 forms should be retained by Schools/Faculties for the statutory retention period. For Research Council funded students a copy of all MA1 forms should be retained by Schools/Faculties for up to 12 months after the grant has closed. MA1 forms will be retained by Funding for two years.
Argos Report for Staff
An Argos report has been developed for staff, enabling them to determine i) which students have awards set up against a particular cost object number, ii) whether the awards have been paid, and iii) if the awards have not yet been paid, what cause of non-payment is likely to be. Staff can find instructions for using the Argos report here.

Student information can be found on our student page: tuition fee liability. This includes information about their statutory right to cancel their contract with the University of Leeds within 14 days of start of term or course start date.
School/Faculty staff are not expected to answer fee queries from leavers. However, students should be signposted to Student Fees as part of the process. 
If a student intending to leave has an urgent?query about their tuition fee liability we are happy to answer this by telephone 0113 343 6700 or email fees@leeds.ac.uk

Queries or complaints that Student Fees receive disputing the leaving date on this letter will be referred to the parent school.
Leaver's form
Research leavers should be directed to the following guidance pages?for leaving their research.
If a taught (UG or TP) student is unable to immediately complete a leavers form please check that this delay will not dramatically impact their fees charged. If?a student?confirms their intention to leave in writing (eg via email) the date of the email can be honoured if a leavers form is completed and processed within two weeks. 
For more information about the taught leavers process please refer to the Student Leavers?pages for staff.
Taught student leavers forms must be completed and?processed within two weeks of the leave date.?If they are not processed in the appropriate timeframe the leave date on the form may not be used and the student may be charged additional fees.

Tuition fee Scholarships and awards ,"University departments?may make tuition fee awards to students, for example?the alumni bursary or as part of a postgraduate research scholarship.?To do this, departments should use a FA1?form. Guidance on how to complete a form is below.
Forms
?

FA1 Form ¨C can be used to authorise and notify Student Fees of fee scholarships
Fee Amendment Form ¨C used to notify Student Fees of an amendment to an existing student fee award
Fee Reversal form ¨C used to notify Student Fees of the need to completely reverse a fee scholarship?

Guidance documentation
?

Guidance document ¨C this is a detailed overview of how to complete the forms, where to send them, and how to request an amendment to an award.

Process Overview: Notifying Student Fees?
?

Individual in the School or Service completes a FA1 form
An Authorised Signatory emails the form directly to FA1@leeds.ac.uk (not cc-ed or bcc-ed).
If all necessary information has been provided and sent by an Authorised Signatory, Student Fees will enter the award on the Banner system.??

?
Student Fees can only accept the approved version of the FA1, Payment Amendment, and Reversal forms due to specific formatting requirements (available above). Any old versions of the form cannot be processed and therefore payments will not be made. Any forms submitted by an unauthorised Signatory cannot be processed.?
Forms, What to Use and How (the Dos and Don'ts)?
Please note that the FA1 form uses macros to facilitate some of the built in functionality and?it is important that once you have finished using the FA1 form you completely close down Excel before continuing on with other work. If you do not completely close Excel?there can be issues with certain action (such as copy and pasting) that occur as a result of the Visual Basic for?Applications (VBA) programme continuing to run in the background.
We have aimed to keep complexity to a minimum however, if you have any issues inputting information on a form, please contact Student Fees and we will be happy to provide you with extra information or training.
Please check carefully that the SID and Surname has been entered correctly before sending. Note, the first name is not required for GDPR compliance.
Is the student eligible for a scholarship? The Fees team do not audit eligibility. For example, if the scholarship is only valid for alumni or self-funding students you must check this before completing the form.
Has the student been informed? Student fees do not contact students to say an award has been added to the system, you must notify the student to ensure they know about any scholarships.
Please send the completed form directly to FA1@leeds.ac.uk (not cc-ed or bcc-ed).
Please do:
?

Check that the Cost Object Number quoted is in a valid format
Check that the Student ID number(s) quoted match the student listed
Only use one cost object/account number per FA1 form. This will greatly help the student fees team when inputting and reduce input errors.
Use a separate form for different academic years or different amounts. This will lessen inputting errors and speed up processing.
Preserve the formatting of the form, especially when pasting in data. The font size must be legible in order for Student Fees to be able to process the payment request.
Complete the relevant Payment Amendment Form for an amendment to an award that does not result in the student receiving increased money or a total reversal of the award.
Complete a Reversal Form where you require the total award to be completely reversed and not just amended.
Make sure that the correct academic year is used. If a form is input to the wrong year, the student may not be able to complete registration.?
Select the correct GL code for the award:

- 56041 for Alumni Bursary only
- 56042 for Fee waivers (for example, a reduction for mitigating circumstances)
- 56040 for all other awards
?

Select the correct Major Source of Funding code. This is always a two digit code. This is so that we can report scholarship information to HESA, it is essential for processing the form. A list of all the Major Source of Funding codes is provided here.
In order to increase an existing award to a student, please send another form for the extra amount only ¨C not for the new overall award total. The amendment form should be sent from an authorised signatory to FA1@leeds.ac.uk
Check that your Authorised Signatory List is up-to-date.
Check that there is enough budget in the account/cost object to cover the award payment.

Please do:
?

Not send replacement/duplicate forms, or forms which supersede previously submitted forms. In the event of a duplicate form being sent, Student fees accept no responsibility for duplicate forms being processed.
Not use the FA1 form to pay for work performed by the recipient for or on behalf of the University of Leeds. If you wish to make a payment directly to the student as an award or maintenance, use the MA1 form. These are processed by the Funding team.
Not add extra students to a form that has already been submitted. Please create a new form
Not alter the form from a landscape set up to portrait as this will affect the ability to input data.
Not leave mandatory fields blank.
Not scan the forms and send them as pdf attachments.
Not send reformat or change any part of the FA1 form.
Not re-send forms to FA1@leeds.ac.uk in order to query them. Any forms sent to this e-mail address are liable to be paid, so re-sending forms could result in a duplicate payment being made. Any queries should be sent to FA1queries@leeds.ac.uk

Changes to Awards/Querying Awards
If a payment needs to be altered, please email a completed Payment Amendment Form to FA1@leeds.ac.uk
If you have any queries regarding the processing of a payment, please contact Student Fees directly for further information.
When to Send an FA1 Form?
Student Fees receive in excess of 5,000 forms each year, mainly during our peak registration period in September. With this in mind, it would be very helpful if FA1¡¯s are sent in advance to ensure processing before registration (but after the general student record has been created in Banner).
Regardless of when the FA1 is processed your account will not be debited until the student completes online registration.
The award must not constitute a refund of an overpayment of accommodation or tuition fee payments made by the student to the University. The student should contact the Fees office directly to discuss the overpayment.
Processing Turnaround
Forms that are correctly completed and authorised will be processed within three working days of receipt. Please note that this may extend to five working days during busy periods.
If forms are completed incorrectly or budgets are exceeded, processing will be delayed and will be three working days from when the issue is resolved. This may require a new FA1 form being submitted with new authorisation.
Retention of FA1 forms
Copies of all FA1 forms should be retained by Schools/Faculties for the statutory retention period. FA1 forms will be retained by Student Fees for two years.

Tuition Payment for Sponsored students,"If a student is being supported by a third party organisation (but not Student Finance or a Research council) they are considered to be sponsored. Proof is required before the student can register.
Sponsor letters
Students with sponsorship must provide evidence of their sponsorship to register at the University, this has to be in an acceptable format?and contain specific information. Information regarding what is required is available on the Sponsored Students?page of the SES student website.
We will invoice sponsors directly for the annual academic fees, this should be paid within 30 days from when they?receive the invoice.
Sponsor evidence for deposit payers
International taught postgraduate students may be asked to provide evidence of sponsorship during the application process. Because this evidence is provided at such an early stage it does not always adhere to the strict rules for registration.
If a student is not sure if their evidence has been accepted for registration they should?email their sponsor?letter to?sponsors@leeds.ac.uk 
Do we need the original letter?
In most cases, sponsors can email us a non-editable version of the sponsor letter: for example, a scanned document, PDF or image file.?Sponsor letters?should be sent to sponsors@leeds.ac.uk 
What if the sponsor does not pay?
If a sponsor does not pay the liability for the payment of fees lies with the student.?Up to date information on this policy?is maintained on the Sponsored students page of the SES student website."
Reduced fees and returners,"If a taught student needs their fee reducing this must be calculated manually. Schools must notify the Student Fees team for this to happen.
Banner?will charge 100% of the fee for the academic session by default. If the student shouldn¡¯t be paying?the full tuition fee a manual reduction is required. You can request waivers by Form 21 and reductions using a Form R. A Form Z can be used to cancel a fee if it is paid for by block-funding.
It is the responsibility of the School/Faculty to identify when a reduction is required, Student Fees will not prompt you to submit a form. Student Fees are happy to provide guidance - please email UGfees@leeds.ac.uk or PGfees@leeds.ac.uk or call ext. 36700 for support.
Processes may change, refer to this page or the Student Fees team before completing your form or informing a student of the process.
FA1 form?¨C Covering fees (Fee Waivers)
An FA1 form is used when the required tuition fee is charged but all or part of the tuition fee is paid from a University account. SAP account details need to be provided to with sufficient funds to cover the tuition fees. An FA1?should be used in the following circumstances:

Reduce/waive fees due to an appeal, complaint, mitigating circumstances
	This may be a decision taken by the School or by the central Student Cases team. In either case, a reduction in tuition fees needs to be covered from a SAP account. When completing the FA1 form you must use GL code 56042 for Fee Waivers. 
Scholarship or bursary
	If a student is receiving a tuition fee scholarship or bursary the SAP account details must be provided.

More information about completing an FA1 form?can be found our page Tuition Fee Scholarships and awards.?
Form R ¨C Reducing fees
Download the Form R??UG template or PG template
A Form R is used to reduce the tuition fee charged. When a fee is reduced using a Form R financial support, HESA data and funding to Schools will be affected. Fee reductions cannot be reversed.

Re-sitting internally or returning from temporary leave
Students can be allowed to resit their studies internally or return from temporary leave part-way through a year. Students must be charged for the time that they are studying. The charging principles vary to reflect student funding eligibility.

Undergraduate Home/EU
	UG Home/EU students will be charged for the term they will be registering for not the credits they will be taking. This is in line with the Student Finance charging policy (100% for three terms, 75% for term 2 and 3 and 50% for term 3 only).
Undergraduate Overseas and all Taught postgraduate students
	UG Overseas and all Taught postgraduate students will be charged for the months they are taking or credits they are studying, depending which is cheaper.

Returning students cannot be charged less than the full value of their programme. Reductions and waivers should be provided by Form 21.
One year programmes?(eg FT Masters) are not fixed at entry. Students who return in a different session will be charged at the current rate for their programme in the year in which they return. ??
Reduced Credits due to Accreditation of Prior Learning
Students who have brought with them credits from a previous course are entitled to a reduced fee in line with their offer letter, this can be requested by completing a Form R.
If you reduce a fee using Form R, this may have an impact on a student's entitlement to University of Leeds and/or external funding.
You must advise each student to contact the Student Funding team so that they understand the financial impact of registering with reduced fees - funding@leeds.ac.uk
Information for students about tuition fee liability can be found on our student pages: http://students.leeds.ac.uk/info/10210/paying_fees_and_charges/608/tuition_fee_liability
Form Z ¨C Cancelling fees
Download?the Form Z template
A Form Z is used to cancel a tuition fee in full. If a fee is cancelled using a Form Z financial support, HESA reporting and funding to Schools will be affected, so a fee can¡¯t subsequently be charged. Multi-lists are accepted.
A Form Z should be only used in the following circumstance:

Externally block funded programmes (eg. LETB, HEEYH)
	If your students receive funding in blocks from an external source, such as NHS funding via the LETB or HEEYH scheme

Authorisation and submission
Forms should be submitted before registration but after the general student record in Banner has been created. Forms received before the student has a Banner record will be rejected.
Faculties or Schools may be requested to cover the cost of maintenance and bursary overpayments caused as a direct result of late Form submission.

Form 21, Form R and Form Z must be approved by an authorised signatory. Approval from an authorised signatory by email is recommended, but approval and the correct completed spreadsheet must be in the same email. This supports us when the documents are audited. More information about authorised signatories can be found at?http://ses.leeds.ac.uk/info/21710/funding_and_awards/1135/authorised_signatories

Financial difficulties,"If you're contacted by students who are experiencing financial hardship due to a variety of different reasons, then they may be eligible for help from the Financial Assistance Fund.
Financial Assistance Fund (FAF)
The FAF provides grants from ¡ê100 to ¡ê4,500 for students in financial difficulty. This could be because of a crisis, a change in circumstances, or simply because the statutory student funding package does not adequately cover essential costs.?
The FAF can't help with tuition fees, nor can it help with University fines or debt. If you are working with students who are having problems with debt, contact the Leeds University Union Advice at Leeds University Union. The Union can also provide help with budgeting, loans, grants and fees.
Download a staff guide to the Financial Assistance Fund, which includes advice on when to make referrals.
The?Financial Assistance Fund?section on the student site has further information for students,?including who can apply and how?decisions are made.?
"
Reduced fees and returners,"If a taught student needs their fee reducing this must be calculated manually. Schools must notify the Student Fees team for this to happen.
Banner?will charge 100% of the fee for the academic session by default. If the student shouldn¡¯t be paying?the full tuition fee a manual reduction is required. You can request waivers by Form 21 and reductions using a Form R. A Form Z can be used to cancel a fee if it is paid for by block-funding.
It is the responsibility of the School/Faculty to identify when a reduction is required, Student Fees will not prompt you to submit a form. Student Fees are happy to provide guidance - please email UGfees@leeds.ac.uk or PGfees@leeds.ac.uk or call ext. 36700 for support.
Processes may change, refer to this page or the Student Fees team before completing your form or informing a student of the process.
FA1 form?¨C Covering fees (Fee Waivers)
An FA1 form is used when the required tuition fee is charged but all or part of the tuition fee is paid from a University account. SAP account details need to be provided to with sufficient funds to cover the tuition fees. An FA1?should be used in the following circumstances:

Reduce/waive fees due to an appeal, complaint, mitigating circumstances
	This may be a decision taken by the School or by the central Student Cases team. In either case, a reduction in tuition fees needs to be covered from a SAP account. When completing the FA1 form you must use GL code 56042 for Fee Waivers. 
Scholarship or bursary
	If a student is receiving a tuition fee scholarship or bursary the SAP account details must be provided.

More information about completing an FA1 form?can be found our page Tuition Fee Scholarships and awards.?
Form R ¨C Reducing fees
Download the Form R??UG template or PG template
A Form R is used to reduce the tuition fee charged. When a fee is reduced using a Form R financial support, HESA data and funding to Schools will be affected. Fee reductions cannot be reversed.

Re-sitting internally or returning from temporary leave
Students can be allowed to resit their studies internally or return from temporary leave part-way through a year. Students must be charged for the time that they are studying. The charging principles vary to reflect student funding eligibility.

Undergraduate Home/EU
	UG Home/EU students will be charged for the term they will be registering for not the credits they will be taking. This is in line with the Student Finance charging policy (100% for three terms, 75% for term 2 and 3 and 50% for term 3 only).
Undergraduate Overseas and all Taught postgraduate students
	UG Overseas and all Taught postgraduate students will be charged for the months they are taking or credits they are studying, depending which is cheaper.

Returning students cannot be charged less than the full value of their programme. Reductions and waivers should be provided by Form 21.
One year programmes?(eg FT Masters) are not fixed at entry. Students who return in a different session will be charged at the current rate for their programme in the year in which they return. ??
Reduced Credits due to Accreditation of Prior Learning
Students who have brought with them credits from a previous course are entitled to a reduced fee in line with their offer letter, this can be requested by completing a Form R.
If you reduce a fee using Form R, this may have an impact on a student's entitlement to University of Leeds and/or external funding.
You must advise each student to contact the Student Funding team so that they understand the financial impact of registering with reduced fees - funding@leeds.ac.uk
Information for students about tuition fee liability can be found on our student pages: http://students.leeds.ac.uk/info/10210/paying_fees_and_charges/608/tuition_fee_liability
Form Z ¨C Cancelling fees
Download?the Form Z template
A Form Z is used to cancel a tuition fee in full. If a fee is cancelled using a Form Z financial support, HESA reporting and funding to Schools will be affected, so a fee can¡¯t subsequently be charged. Multi-lists are accepted.
A Form Z should be only used in the following circumstance:

Externally block funded programmes (eg. LETB, HEEYH)
	If your students receive funding in blocks from an external source, such as NHS funding via the LETB or HEEYH scheme

Authorisation and submission
Forms should be submitted before registration but after the general student record in Banner has been created. Forms received before the student has a Banner record will be rejected.
Faculties or Schools may be requested to cover the cost of maintenance and bursary overpayments caused as a direct result of late Form submission.

Form 21, Form R and Form Z must be approved by an authorised signatory. Approval from an authorised signatory by email is recommended, but approval and the correct completed spreadsheet must be in the same email. This supports us when the documents are audited. More information about authorised signatories can be found at?http://ses.leeds.ac.uk/info/21710/funding_and_awards/1135/authorised_signatories

Creating new exchanges,"If you are thinking about setting up a new exchange for study abroad, please contact the Study Abroad Office and complete a proposal for a new study abroad agreement.
How to set up a new exchange
If you would like to set up a new exchange for study abroad, please contact the Study Abroad Office (SAO) before completing any documentation. The SAO?will give you advice on what information you will need and discuss the general suitability of the proposed partner. This includes consideration about whether the link is likely to be reciprocal as all exchanges are based on one student in for one out.
For further information, please contact?Ben Oldham?(Study Abroad Manager).
Process after contacting the Study Abroad Office?
The proposer?must complete a?proposal for a new study abroad agreement and a partner report before a new study abroad partner can be approved.
If the university is an existing partner, a partner report is not necessary. A partner report can be completed by the proposed partner however this should be checked and, if necessary, added to by the proposing school. A site visit is recommended before a new agreement is created although this is at the discretion of the proposing school.
If you are considering language preparation content for a new proposal then please refer to the Language Attainment Guidelines.

The completed proposal documents for a new student exchange agreement should be submitted in the first instance to the relevant School Taught Student Education Committee (STSEC) and then to the Study Abroad Programme Approval Group (SAPAG).
The STSEC will consider the proposal with regard to:?
	a)?the academic coherence of the programme;?
	b)?the linguistic preparedness of outgoing students;?
	c)?the likelihood of student demand in both directions such that the exchange will be balanced;?
	d)?the suitability of the partner institution, including national and international ranking and professional accreditations, where relevant;?
	e) the student support arrangements, as described in the partner report;?
	f)?if consideration has been given to creating partnerships with existing partners
The SAPAG will review the recommendation of the STSEC and also consider the wider institutional strategic fit. SAPAG decisions will be communicated to the proposer and the relevant STSEC. SAPAG has a meeting schedule to consider proposals but can also approve proposals outside of the meetings to expedite the process as appropriate. SAPAG is chaired by a Pro-Dean for International and includes Study Abroad office staff and School Study Abroad Coordinators.

No arrangement can be implemented unless it has been approved in full by the Study Abroad Programme Approval Group. The Study Abroad office will then negotiate the formal legal agreement and arrange for the partnership to be advertised to students.

Leeds International Summer School,"Since 2010 Leeds International Summer School (LISS) has attracted students from all over the world to take part in an academic, cultural and social programme lasting two ¨C four weeks in July. ?The credit-bearing programme is diverse and attracts students from all over the world.?
Watch the recording of an?online information session for staff to find out more about how you can get involved.

Following incremental growth over 8 years, LISS 2019 saw a tripling of student numbers to almost 300. This growth reflects the deliberate positioning of LISS as an important contributor to the University¡¯s International Strategy and Global Opportunities Plan. ??
We are looking for academic staff and Postgraduate Researchers who are interested in delivering teaching as part of LISS. Find out more a below, or contact the LISS Manager, Lisa Beare.?Full details of the programme are on the LISS website.?
Why LISS matters?
Our aim is to continue to grow the International Summer School based on the following benefits.??
Institutional ?

The summer school has potential for income generation to re-invest in student mobility, for example widening participation scholarships and outgoing summer school bursaries. ? ?
LISS is offered on exchange (i.e. with a tuition fee waiver) for key strategic partners which is offset against our full-year outgoing students enabling more of our students to be mobile. We are unable to meet current demand for our outgoing students as we do not attract sufficient incoming students from the destinations our students prefer. The summer school therefore plays a significant role in maintaining outgoing opportunities at these institutions. ? ?
LISS is also used to target markets for PGT/PGR recruitment. According to the end of LISS survey, 80% of LISS students seek information about further study at Leeds. ? ?
Hosting an international summer school supports our international profile and can often be an offer to emerging partners without the need to set up full student exchanges. Arrangements are made for group bookings at strategic partners for example where traditional exchange is unlikely to be viable. ??

School and Faculty ?
LISS supports the international strategy of Schools and Faculties and delivering teaching as part of the summer school offers the following benefits: ?

Showcase teaching and research strengths to prospective Postgraduate students. ??
Provide Professional Development for staff and PGR through tailoring and delivering existing modules or building new 10 credit modules. ??
Pilot new disciplinary or interdisciplinary modules. ? ?
Transferability of content and methods to support internationalisation of the curriculum. ?
Contribution to ensuring outgoing places continue to be available to students through the exchange agreements and outgoing summer schools. ??
Provides an infrastructure to accommodate school or faculty requests to develop bespoke summer schools. ?

Individual Benefit - for LISS module leaders ?

Opportunity for staff and Postgraduate Researchers to deliver intensive teaching to an international audience?
Staff are financially rewarded ? ?
Staff enjoy the overall LISS experience, leading modules and teaching LISS students?

Module details?
LISS modules usually:?

are level 1 and worth 10 credits?
are delivered over 2 weeks (either block one or block two of the summer school) ?
involve a minimum of 24 hours of seminar-style teaching over 8 days (usually mornings 9.30am ¨C 12.30pm) ?
include a full day field trip led by the module leader/teaching assistant?
have small class sizes ¨C minimum of 9 and maximum of 30 ??
are taught above workload? ?
can be taught by one module leader, or by two or more members of staff. NB Postgraduate Researchers are encouraged to lead modules and/or deliver teaching if they have teaching experience.?
have coursework assessments e.g. written work, presentations, reflective logs, portfolios, reports (there is no exam period)?

Details of current LISS modules are available on the LISS website and you can download the LISS Module Tutor job role?and the LISS Module Teaching Assistant role. Please contact the LISS Team if your School or Faculty is seeking to develop an international summer opportunity that does not fit the standard LISS model outlined above e.g. upper level module, non-credit bearing, longer/shorter than two weeks etc. It may still be possible to take advantage of the infrastructure of LISS e.g. admissions, programming, student experience etc. for these models.?
Staff profiles


Stacey Mottershaw, Teaching Fellow

I joined the Leeds International Summer School (LISS) as module leader for 'Applied Ethics for Business and Society' in 2019. It was nice to have the opportunity to create a new module on a topic that I was particularly interested in, and my experience of submitting a new module to our PAG gave me an insight into the quality assurance process undertaken at Leeds.
I thoroughly enjoyed teaching the module and although I was initially concerned about teaching a 100% international cohort, I was pleasantly surprised at the high academic calibre and English language skills of my students. Teaching the module intensively over two weeks of the summer was a novel and rewarding experience; in addition to giving me space to try out new techniques with a smaller class, it allowed me to fully focus on and engage with the module and my students without the distractions of a usual semester.
The timing of the module also allowed me to reflect on my teaching ahead of the following academic year. In terms of my own professional development, I used my experience of leading the module in my PRiSE application, following which I was successfully awarded Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA, Advance HE) in December 2019.
In summary, I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending LISS to colleagues - the team have been a pleasure to work with and I thoroughly enjoyed delivering a module as part of this key international activity.

Ian Sapiro, Associate Professor

I¡¯ve been teaching a course on ¡®Music in Film¡¯ as part of LISS for the past four years, and each year has brought something different. The students come from a wide range of backgrounds ¨C geographic, cultural and educational, not to mention (specifically for my module) musical and filmic ¨C and this usually leads to a rich and varied classroom experience.
I have learned to think differently about my points of reference and what might be considered general knowledge in my subject area, and I think this has been of benefit to me when developing and delivering my teaching to the students on our undergraduate Music degree courses.
I have always found the students on LISS to be engaging and enthusiastic, and the experience of teaching them to be fulfilling and (believe it or not) fun. Similarly, the LISS team is very easy to work with, well organised, excellent communicators and very supportive of the academics delivering the modules.

About the Leeds Curriculum,"The Leeds Curriculum aims to produce graduates who stand out as a result of the knowledge, skills and attributes they have gained. ?
Their ability to talk clearly and confidently about their experiences also makes our graduates distinctive and is complemented by co-curricular learning opportunities through LeedsforLife.?
The Leeds Curriculum

The curriculum has three key components:?

Research-Based Learning
Joining an academic community, a student begins their undergraduate journey learning about the latest research. As they progress through their programme, they will develop skills and knowledge and ultimately experience research first-hand in their final year project, supervised by staff who themselves are engaged in cutting-edge research.
Programme threads
Each programme incorporates the following:?? 

Employability - raising awareness of key attributes and skills and developing these to help our students realise their career aspirations. 
Global and cultural insight - there will be opportunities to engage with and value multiple perspectives (social, geographic, political, economic, legal, environmental and technological) and acknowledging and appreciating diversity. 
Ethics and responsibility - engaging with ethical issues to demonstrate how to act responsibly and professionally and to make informed decisions. 

Broadening through Discovery Themes
Broadening enables students to explore key questions that will affect their future lives. It develops intellectual flexibility and enables them to compete and contribute in the workplace and wider society and have further opportunities to enrich their education, for example, through study abroad and work experience. Students can broaden their intellectual horizons within or outside their degree programme(s) by studying modules within ten interdisciplinary Discovery Themes.
Discovery Themes
There are hundreds of?discovery modules available. These are grouped into Discovery Themes and associated sub-themes, bringing together related teaching from across the University. Students will benefit from this coordinated and structured means to broadening their learning. They can choose modules which might explore a specific subject, issue or skill within or beyond their chosen subject. The Leeds for Life website gives further guidance to students.

 
 
"
Broadening education choices,"Students can broaden their intellectual horizons outside or within 
their subject areas through discovery themes and other opportunities 
made available to them.
Below you can find detailed information about our core programme 
threads - which should be incorporated into all students' courses - and 
the discovery themes and modules which students can take to broaden 
their education. Core programme threadsThe core programme threads of employability, global and cultural insight and ethics and responsibility
 should be incorporated into all programmes in the context of the 
discipline to guarantee all students are exposed to each of them 
whatever course or modules they take.? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   All University of Leeds programmes will provide:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

exposure for all students to all threads
exposure to threads at more than one level
assessment of activities which constitute the threads ie, 
students will be able to show evidence of their exposure to, and 
progression within the threads, by reference to formative or summative 
assessments or learning activities.
Broadening and discovery themes
 Adaptive

To allow students to adapt the knowledge from their primary 
discipline in different ways and to different contexts, which could take
 the form of:
Testing of discipline-specific knowledge in relation to other 
academic contexts, approaches and debates; thus developing 
inter-disciplinary perspectives and sharpening vital transferable skills
 in critical thinking, evidence evaluation, debate, communications etc.
Adapting discipline-specific knowledge to contexts (both vocational and non-vocational) beyond the University.
Training to develop skills (languages, IT, communication 
techniques) which could enable a broader and more flexible approach to 
the primary discipline, and/or an approach applying? disciplinary 
understanding to? specific careers contexts.
Specific skills development to reinforce the employability 
outcomes of the primary degree subject, including placements, project 
work, collaborative work.
Supplementary
 To allow students to undertake subjects outside of their main discipline, this could include: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Opportunities to undertake modules outside their discipline to 
address personal interests or explore new ideas, under particular 
themes.
Opportunities to diversify the individual student curriculum to 
address an identified need (such as a second subject for those going 
into secondary school teaching or the acquisition of a language to 
enable an international profession).
Opportunities to add academic value to the University of Leeds 
graduate; this is potentially an alternative logic for modules 
developing skills/understanding of foreign languages, computing, etc.
Opportunities to gain understanding of commercial environments, enterprise and entrepreneurship.
It has been agreed that the Discovery Themes define the breadth 
of the curriculum. Most students will engage with Broadening through 
taking Discovery Modules but some will engage with the Discovery Themes 
through their programme of study.
Discovery theme
 ¡®A coordinated and structured series of related discovery 
modules allowing sustained exploration of a specific subject, issue or 
skill which lies beyond the primary disciplinary content of a student¡¯s 
programme.¡¯
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   Discovery themes:

have a clear focus but include a range of alternative modules ¨C 
allowing choice for students and some flexibility in timetabling around 
study for the home degree
offer modules over at least 2 levels (and ideally 3 levels) to allow for progression
are constructed so as to ensure that a student who exits after 
study at only one level also has a satisfactory and stimulating 
experience are sufficiently flexible to accommodate unorthodox 
progression paths ¨C eg a student who begins a strand at L1, exits for a 
year and subsequently re-enters, or a student who exits one strand after
 L1 and begins another at L2. In some cases, however, such ¡®transfers¡¯ 
would continue to be subject to completion of an appropriate 
prerequisite.
Discovery modulesDiscovery modules should:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

be appropriate to be taken by students from outside the discipline
provide opportunities for student engagement in addition to 
large-group lecturing so as to facilitate deeper learning and academic/ 
social interaction between individuals drawn from different degree 
programmes
normally be 10 or 20 credits so that they can be more readily accommodated within the home programme of the discovery student
prerequisites for discovery modules are discouraged to allow student mobility. Where prerequisites are necessary, they should be as wide as possible (eg maths at A level or skills requirement) and avoid listing specific modules. Where modules are listed, they should be Discovery modules and ideally a range of Discovery modules from a relevant Discovery Theme
All discovery modules will form part of a discovery theme. The themes are:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

Creating Sustainable Futures
Enterprise and Innovation
Ethics, Religion and Law
Exploring the Sciences
Languages and Intercultural Understanding
Media, Culture and Creativity
Mind and Body
Personal and Professional Development
Power and Conflict
Technology and its Impacts
Discovery Theme and sub-theme titles, as well as contact details for Discovery Theme Leaders are available on the Discovery Themes website"
Core Programme Threads,"The Core Programme Threads should be incorporated into all programmes in the context of the discipline to guarantee that all students are exposed to each of them, whatever programme or modules they take.
All Leeds programmes will provide:
 

Exposure for all students to all threads;
Exposure to threads at more than one level; and
Assessment of activities which constitute the threads (i.e. students will be able to show evidence of their exposure to, and progression within, the Threads by reference to formative or summative assessment or learning activities).


The Core Programme Threads are defined as follows:
Ethics and Responsibility
The programme should provide opportunities for students to engage with the ethical issues of the discipline and to demonstrate how, more generally, to behave responsibly and professionally. As a result, a student/graduate should be:
 

Ethically aware;
Self-aware;
Reflective and critical; and
A considered and informed decision maker.

Global and Cultural Insight 
The programme should provide opportunities for students to engage with multiple perspectives (e.g. social, geographic, political, economic, legal, environmental and technological). As a result, a student/graduate should be equipped to:
 

Acknowledge and appreciate the implications of diversity;
Reflect on the value of having multiple perspectives;
Engage with the international issues and the development of the programme content; and
Be effective in a range of contexts.

Employability 
The programme should provide opportunities for students to develop the attributes that will make them employable. As a result, a student/graduate should be:
 

Aware of the skills they need to be employable;
Able to articulate and provide evidence of their skills in a range of circumstances (academic and employment);
Ready to compete for opportunities and be successful in the workplace; and
A lifelong learner who is effective in a work environment.?

"
Enhancing teaching and research-based learning,"Research-based learning has always been at the core of our 
programmes. This page defines what research-based learning is and 
highlights the benefits of this approach. 
Research-based learning
 
 
Definition

All programmes will actively develop students¡¯ independent 
research skills and provide students with opportunities to put these 
skills into practice such that at the culmination of the programme, 
students are able to undertake, with supervision, a final year project;
the characteristics of our research strengths will underpin all our programmes;
the latest research, including that produced by our own staff, will contribute to the curriculum; and
our students can articulate the benefits of their research-based
 experience, and describe the skills they¡¯ve acquired and demonstrated.
 

 Benefits of research-based learningOur approach to RBL has many benefits for our students, which include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

The latest research, including that developed by our own staff, 
contributes to the curriculum of all our programmes ¨C emphasising the 
¡®why¡¯ and ¡®how¡¯ not just the facts.
Students are taught in the context of leading-edge research 
being undertaken on campus, without the inevitable time delay or 
potential misinterpretation that might arise from basing teaching on 
external research papers or text-books.
Students have access to resources on campus that are essential for high quality research-based learning.
Active engagement with research provides a more enjoyable and stimulating university experience.
Our academic community and our programmes produces graduates 
with the desire and skills to pursue new knowledge and a commitment to 
lifelong learning.
Graduates are able to articulate their desire to acquire new 
knowledge, the value of that process and the skills they have that 
enable them to do it.
Graduates perceive themselves to be able to generate knowledge for the future.
Graduates are well equipped to be attractive and successful in the employment market.
 

 
Principles 

Research-based learning (RBL) is the fundamental basis of all 
our programmes and should be evident in all modules.? Even those that 
might be described as ¡®basic¡¯ in that the origins of basic knowledge 
once too must have derived from original research or thought.
It will be expected that even the most intensive research-active staff will engage with this agenda.
Within the context of the discipline, all undergraduate 
programmes will demonstrate explicitly the integration of research with 
learning and teaching, incorporating the development, practise and 
assessment of appropriate academic skills and competencies (¡®academic 
literacy¡¯).
RBL can be characterised as a journey, taking students from 
their school-based experience through research-led teaching to 
research-based learning ¨C a journey from being taught to being 
autonomous, self-reliant, supported and supervised.? The Healey matrix 
provides a simple and widely applicable model to characterise that 
journey. The descriptors derived by staff at the University of Adelaide 
in their Research Skills Development Framework provide a more detailed 
depiction of the level of autonomy and research focus. It is unrealistic
 to imagine that any programme would lead to a simple linear journey 
from research-led (ie largely taught) to research-based (ie able to 
undertake research activity? autonomously), however, programmes should 
be able to describe a process by which students encounter predominantly 
teaching about research (content, methods, ethics, outcomes, critique, 
etc) in their early levels of study and engage in more self-directed, 
supervised research activity in later years, apply skills acquired 
earlier in their programmes of study.
The programme as a whole should frame the RBL journey and within
 this all modules should be able to be located within the Healey 
matrix.? Schools should be able to demonstrate how any programme will 
take all students through the RBL journey from research-led teaching to 
research-based learning, irrespective of the options a student might 
choose.

Progression
 All/the majority of modules will have some aspect of 
the RBL journey in them.? Schools should be able to identify where, 
within the Healey matrix, each module sits and therefore be able to 
demonstrate progression. ?
 
 
 
 
 
 
   Some modules might be specifically targeted at preparing a 
student for the journey (eg research skills), others might provide an 
opportunity to develop and practise the skills and attributes needed to 
enable them (eg in their final year) to complete a major piece of 
research-based learning (research project, dissertation). ?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   To assist programme teams with this task, the Group recommends
 that both the Healey matrix and the Adelaide Descriptors be used in 
conjunction to identify where modules within programmes align with the 
developmental process from research-led to research-based.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   Mapping research-based learning in the curriculum 
 Active consideration of module mapping against the Healey 
Matrix/Adelaide descriptors would help to demonstrate the distinctive 
nature of our programmes, and it would be appropriate to ask DSEs, with 
the respective programme managers, to review the current status and to 
recommend changes through the S/FSECs. In the great majority of cases 
this exercise would involve highlighting where RBL already exists, 
rather than major modification.?? Ongoing auditing of the RBL structure 
would need to be embedded in course approval, Annual Health Checks and, 
most importantly, the IPE.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   A simple module audit, undertaken initially by module 
leaders/teams, to identify where within the matrix/descriptors a module 
predominantly aligns would be a useful starting point. SSECs (or 
subgroups thereof) may then provide an overview such as to assure the 
School that students do transit from largely research-led early in their
 studies to more research-based in final years. SSEC may also provide a 
checking service to ensure that a sample of modules across the programme
 have been appropriately labelled within the Matrix. The 
Matrix/Descriptors are self-explanatory; module leaders need simply 
consider the content, delivery and assessment of a module, and see how 
that best fits with the descriptions of student activity/focus.? An 
audit and mapping toolkit has been agreed to help Faculties and Schools 
evidence the presence of RBL. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?"
Final year project and assessment,"All students at the University undertake an autonomous piece of 
research work known as a final year project as the culmination of their 
programme. 
This piece of work is seen by students as the pinnacle of their 
academic achievement, not only because of the academic rigour that is 
imposed on it by the University, but also because of the control they 
have to design, carry out and evaluate what they do.? It is often seen 
to represent the point at which students become truly members of a 
disciplinary group.
 A summary of the characteristics of the Final Year Project is 
provided below and detailed guidelines have been developed for use by 
schools who are setting up new FYPs or reviewing existing arrangements 
to ensure they meet the requirements of the new Leeds Curriculum.
 
 
 
 
 
 
   It has been agreed that this piece of work will have the 
following characteristics (the guidelines include additional 
requirements for joint honours programmes):
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

be compulsory for all undergraduate students who start their degree programme in 2014/15.
normally be at least 40 credits to recognise the significant 
contribution it makes to the University of Leeds curriculum. In 
exceptional circumstances, where the intellectual coherence of the 
programme would otherwise be undermined, a minimum of 20 credits would 
be acceptable. Any rating below 40 credits should be considered by the 
appropriate FTSEC which will need to be assured that the project 
provides an appropriate experience for the student to evidence their 
independent research skills
be assessed in a way which relates to it being a research based activity at undergraduate level
be supervised within the school (although there may be occasions
 where co-supervision is the best way forward, where this can be 
negotiated)
result in an individual report? responding to a question 
negotiated at the level of the individual student (which may fit 
together into a piece of work which a group could do)
be undertaken according to a research method defined by the student in their report

See FYP options for Joint Honours programmes for further guidance.
 Assessment
 Best practice would be to consider double-blind marking. Where
 this is not possible, and where the main form of assessment is a piece 
of written work, then the assessment must be read by two markers, both 
of whom must be members of academic staff and one of whom must be 
independent of the setting or supervising of the project.? There must be
 a clear process for moderation where there are major discrepancies 
between markers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   See FYP marking recommendations for more information. ? ? ? ? ?"

Appeals (taught students),"Definitive procedure for students on taught programmes or modules to appeal against the results of University examinations and assessments. 
The appeals process is owned by the Student Cases team in the Secretariat.

Attendance code of practice (taught students),"Students are expected to attend all timetabled sessions. The University is clear about its expectations of students and in the information that schools provide to students to enable them to attend regularly.
University code of practice
The sessions organised as part of a programme of study - lectures, group work, laboratory work, tutorials, seminars and practical classes - are a crucial part of enabling students to achieve the maximum benefit from their time at the University.

Attendance at designated online and remote sessions is compulsory irrespective of whether or not a module forms a core, optional or elective part of a programme of study.
Schools will have procedures for students to report absence / monitor engagement?and make clear the procedures for students to apply for leave of absence in exceptional circumstances.
Schools will have a clear process for monitoring?student engagement?and addressing any patterns of non-attendance or low attendance?at an early stage. Where non-attendance is a potential problem a ""warning system"" will be in place for the student. If the problem continues the Unsatisfactory Work, Attendance and Engagement Procedure will be used.
Co-curricular activities and paid employment must normally be fitted around formal timetable commitments. Wednesday afternoons, that is from 1.00pm, will normally be kept free for co-curricular activities. On occasions where a student is involved in a University supported activity, eg competing in a national sporting event or representing the University in a sporting event, which involves leaving a timetabled session before 1.00pm they must notify the tutor in advance in order to discuss how the session commitments might be met in another way. It is the responsibility of the student to find out what work has been missed and to complete any tasks set.
Schools will indicate normal teaching hours making special arrangements to meet the needs of students undertaking religious observance.
Schools will make clear the preparation students are expected to undertake before each timetabled session and whether supporting material is needed for use in class.
Sessions will start promptly at five minutes past the hour and end promptly at five minutes to the hour, unless otherwise agreed with students for a particular session/module.?
Timetabled sessions will only be cancelled in exceptional and unavoidable circumstances, eg staff illness, and alternative arrangements made to minimise disruption for students.?
Staff will all be made aware of the school policy on non-engagement to prevent variability in the treatment of students.
The school policy on?engagement will be considered annually by the Student:Staff committee.
The Dean of Faculty is responsible for ensuring compliance by schools with this code of practice.

Criminal records,"We do not wish to prevent those with criminal records from benefitting from higher education. This has to be balanced with providing a safe environment in which to work and study.
The policy on applicants and students with criminal records, located on the Student Cases webpage, explains the process used in considering applications from those with criminal records and how applicants can appeal against the decision made.?The obligations on applicants and students to declare criminal records are also described.
Who is required to declare a conviction
Applicants for most courses?are not?required to declare whether they have any relevant unspent criminal convictions at the time of application, but they will need to declare them if they accept an offer. Only applicants for courses leading to certain professions or occupations may be asked?to declare if?they have any criminal convictions, including spent convictions, when they apply.
At undergraduate level, through UCAS, these courses include (but are not limited to) teaching, medicine, dentistry, law, accountancy, actuarial, insolvency, healthcare, social work,?veterinary medicine, veterinary science, pharmacy, osteopathy, chiropractic, optometry, and those involving work with children or vulnerable adults, including the elderly or sick people. At postgraduate level, where applications are made directly to the University, these courses include dentistry, social work and counselling.
If you feel that your course should be flagged and this has not already been done, please contact Taught Admissions on ug_enquiry@leeds.ac.uk?(undergraduate) or tp_enquiry@leeds.ac.uk (taught postgraduate).
The declaration process
Where the course requires?a full DBS disclosure, follow your set procedure.
For courses where a criminal conviction declaration is not included in the application form and a DBS check is not required, applicants must?disclose any relevant unspent convictions within 14 days of accepting an offer, by emailing declaration@leeds.ac.uk. The following details are required: name, UCAS/application/student ID number, programme applied for and the?title of the offence, including the date and sentence imposed.
Once all information has been collated, an initial assessment of risk will be undertaken by one of the three Admissions staff who manage the process.?The initial assessment recommendation and associated information will be pseudonymised and forwarded to the Criminal Conviction Panel, which will consist of two representatives from the following: a Deputy Head of Admissions; the Head of Admissions; a?Legal Adviser;?a?member of the Secretariat. They will review the case and will reach one of three conclusions:

Confirm the offer with no changes or additional restrictions.
Propose additional conditions on the applicant¡¯s?admission. These could include restricting their module choices or rejecting their application to stay in University accommodation, or restricting it to certain locations.?
Withdraw the offer.

Engagement monitoring FAQs,"To help you find the information you need to manage the revised engagement monitoring guidance, we¡¯ve?collated some?frequently asked questions covering key themes and concerns.
Q. How will student engagement be monitored in the new hybrid learning environment?
A revised process for monitoring student engagement has been developed which takes account of the move to remote teaching and ensures compliance e.g. for UKVI. The approach is based on access to modules in Minerva, with minimum requirements set as baseline expectations for ¡°no engagement¡± and ¡°low engagement¡±. Full detail is shared in the Standard Operating Procedure for Attendance Monitoring 2020-21 template.
Q. How will student engagement be monitored in the new hybrid learning environment?
For online learning, academic staff will no longer be required to maintain attendance registers. But, for face-to-face teaching delivery, staff will need to take a non-physical register of attendees via verbal roll-call and directly input this to Faculty Services, for Track and Trace purposes and hybrid delivery engagement monitoring. For large teaching sessions (30+ students), it is suggested staff utilise Top Hat or similar software. Once this information is in Faculty Services, individual schools/ faculties will work with the Education Engagement Student Support Officers to ask for this additional data to be added to the weekly engagement reports. Until this work can be completed, we expect that it will require manual interventions/cross-checking with Argos reporting, until the process can be more ¡°automated¡± (semester 1).
Q. What support is available to address non-attendance, especially where students have not formally said they will not be in face to face attendance?
In the first instance, SES teams will need to refer to the ¡°Campus Status of Student¡± Argos report to cross-check for any causes of concern. The EE Student Success team hope to add the ¡°Campus Status of Student¡± flag in the Minerva Engagement Monitoring weekly reports in semester 1 (once full testing has been completed). This will allow SES attendance teams to easily identify students who may fall into this category. Faculty/school SES teams will then follow the No engagement or Low engagement intervention pathways, to identify, follow-up and support any ¡°at risk¡± students in these areas. The SES attendance teams also have access to additional contextual data within the reports, so this will help them support student wellbeing and engagement.
Q. What approach should we take with students who have a high overall engagement ¨C but low engagement on one module?
The steer is for schools to focus on overall student engagement across all their modules (low module accesses as a minimum requirement), there is no expectation that SES teams will focus on low engagement in just one module. However, this data (and the module level report) can be used to drill-down and better understand ¡°at risk¡± students as part of any further investigation. This will be left to the discretion of SES teams to manage. It is important to note that a Module and/or Programme leader may wish to review low engagement on a per module basis, however, the escalation procedure should only be triggered where engagement is low overall.
Q. What approach should we take with students who jump between no engagement and low engagement?
Schools should be advised that where patterns of low and no engagement occur the ¡®low engagement¡¯ escalation route is preferred, however, the school attendance contact(s) are encouraged to use their professional discretion to manage students on a case-by-case basis.
Q. Do the reports measures include access time in Collaborate Ultra Sessions?
No ¨C Minerva Analytics reporting does not provide cross-system reports yet, therefore, the data is based solely on the students¡¯ engagement with their learning and teaching materials within Module Channels.
Q. Do the report measures include data on Organisations?
No ¨C the current reports only surface measures for student activity in module channels. It is possible to surface engagement measures within Organisations, but this would require a new reporting structure. Organisations also tend to be connected to school learning and teaching activities (information on the SES team, signposting to resources, etc.), so it may not be an accurate additional measure of regular student engagement.
Q. What about Students in shared households studying the same Programme?
The Minerva Analytics reports are looking at individual student engagement in their modules (not Blackboard Collaborate teaching). However, if a student has technical issues or has informed the school that they share a laptop with other students, then this should be flagged on a local level so the student does not get sent through the engagement escalation procedure if this is the sole reason why the student¡¯s overall participation looks low.
Q. What happens if students are consistently not attending their face-to-face teaching, and choosing only to engage online?
The need for teaching staff to take registers of their face-to-face sessions is an important part of the process of identifying students who are not attending face-to-face sessions when they are expected to attend. SES teams may need to use this information to have a conversation with the student about submitting a request to the Head of School (or their academic designee) for a late physical arrival. If this is not approved, the student would be recommended (via Head of School or their designee) to take 2020-21 as an Exceptional Leave year. If teaching staff do have concerns about a specific student, please do not hesitate to contact your SES team for further discussion.
Q. What about students taking optional/discovery modules (provided by another School) and joint-honours programmes?
Engagement monitoring is the responsibility of the parent School. The reports are generated at a student level, which enables the parent school to monitor and track engagement across all modules. It is recommended that the teaching school may need to have a local discussion with the parent school to discuss approach for the sharing of information of students on shared programmes of study.
Q. I still have more Engagement Monitoring questions. Who do I speak to?
If you have any further questions, please contact your local SES team Attendance contact or your Faculty Programme Support Functional Manager. For queries related to higher and degree apprenticeships, please contact the Head of Learning Enhancement, Isobel Whitehouse.

Equality and inclusion,"Inclusiveness is one of the core University values. This framework explains how we will incorporate inclusiveness throughout our cultures, business and day-to-day organisational practice.
The equality and inclusion framework, on the Equality Policy Unit website, provides information about how equality and inclusiveness are integral to our culture."
Fitness to practice,"This relates to students registered on programmes leading to award by relevant statutory bodies in medicine, dentistry, midwifery, nursing, radiography, other healthcare professions and teaching.
The code of practice on student health and conduct (PDF), located on the Student Cases webpage, provides procedures for handling those non-academic matters of student health and conduct which may have a bearing on fitness to practise professionally but which do not fall within the scope of the University's general disciplinary and health regulations."
Laptop loans for students,"If students are experiencing difficulties accessing the online or digital aspects of their learning they should discuss this with their Academic Personal Tutor and/or SES student support team to establish the nature of the difficulty and explore solutions.
If access to appropriate equipment is an issue, laptops are available for students to borrow and mobile internet can be provided.
Information and help with home internet
There is information and tips about home internet and broadband on the IT website.

A student home wifi/internet helpdesk will be running from Mon 10th?May to Fri 30th?July.??
Students would access the desk by ringing the main IT Service desk telephone number 0113 343 3333 and then selecting option 1,?when prompted.
The desk will be available Monday-Friday between the hours of 08:00-16:00.

?
Initial checks to make
Laptops and mobile internet are available on loan should students need them, but please ensure all avenues have been explored before going down this route ¨C it may be that hardware is not the issue and that with IT support, training or advice, the student¡¯s issues may be resolved.
If it becomes apparent that the student needs IT equipment, typically a laptop but also mobile internet, in order to access their learning, the relevant Faculty Student Support Manager will be able to make a request to IT services for the provision of loan equipment.
Laptop loans and mobile internet are available to all UG and PGT students where, following a review of their situation, it is clear that a laptop loan or mobile internet is the best solution.

The following groups will be prioritised:

Plus Programme
Lifelong Learning Centre
Sociology Foundation Year
Gateway to Medicine
Care experienced / estranged students
Carers
Leeds Masters Scholars
Mature students

This process does exclude short term requests. At this moment in time we cannot offer this as a service due to significant logistical challenges. We will let you know when this service resumes.
Loan request process

Students should discuss difficulties in accessing their learning with their Academic Personal Tutor or their Student Support Office.
The Student Support Offices will use an IT online form to capture all relevant information gathered from students and/or their tutors. Not all support colleagues will have access to this form.
Where anything other than the standard specification is needed the Student Support Office will need confirmation as to which specification is needed and why (e.g.? e-mail from a module or academic personal tutor explaining the reasons).
IT Service Desk will fulfil all loan requests raised and will allocate a laptop for that specific student.

It won¡¯t be possible to record a loan if there is a request in pending status or an active loan recorded for the same student
Three specification options are available:

Students in crisis,"News of a student's death or other crisis (for example, life-threatening illness, serious injury/ accident, attack or attempted suicide) can reach the University in a number of different ways, the following reporting process should be followed..
REPORTING CHANNELS
The most important basis for good decision-making in crisis management is good information. Therefore, being fully informed and up to date at all times is essential, a constant flow of information is needed and ideally in real time. It is vital that all information relevant to the case is coordinated and communicated through a single channel to avoid duplication and confusion.
All reporting and communication should be made to the University Secretary ?and the Deputy Secretary who will alert the Coordinating Team and School and/ or Halls of Residence. ?

Student Counselling and wellbeing,"From time to time you may need to refer students to other support services in the University if they are finding it hard to cope, or to get specialist support for issues they may be going through.
When students experience problems it can be helpful to talk over the situation with someone else who is not involved. This can be a friend or a close family member or it can be a counsellor who has the professional skills and expertise to assist people with emotional and psychological difficulties.
Referring students to the Student Counselling and wellbeing
This information is for staff who have concerns about a student and may be considering referring the student for counselling. If you have any questions about the process you may consult a counsellor in confidence prior to a referral, preferably without revealing the student's identity.
What we offerCounselling provides people the time and space to explore problems and come to a deeper understanding of themselves and their choices confidentially.We provide:

Therapeutic Consultations 
Information about therapeutic resources 
Individual counselling 
Workshops 
Meditation group 
Web based self-help resources 
Big White Wall

Following online application to the Student Counselling and Wellbeing, a Therapeutic Consultation (TC) with a Senior Practitioner provides a student with a one-off opportunity to explore the problems that concern them, and to identify ways to help them move forward. The TC may result in identifying strategies or tasks to try out, and/or referring the student to useful resources. A short follow-up is usually offered 3-4 weeks later. Some students will be referred for counselling, which gives time and space to explore problems and come to a deeper understanding of themselves and their choices confidentially.
Who to refer
Those students who:?

Can be helped more effectively by a professional counsellor 
Do not respond readily to your own offers of help 
Are unable to concentrate on their studies because of personal difficulties 
Are anxious, depressed or feeling suicidal. 

How to refer

Let the student know about the boundaries and limitations of your role 
Explain the nature of the help that might be offered 
Encourage students to make appointments themselves by directing them to the self-referral form 
Let the student know that referral to a counsellor does not cut them off from your own care and concern. 

The Tutor's role after referral
How staff can continue to monitor a student they are concerned about after referral to the Student Counselling and Wellbeing:

Explain the boundaries of your tutorial relationship with the student, eg counsellor - personal counselling; tutor - academic support 
Ask the student directly what support they require from you 
Set contracts, for example; agree to meet every fortnight at a set time to come together 
Ask the student to monitor his or her progress. 

Critical Incidents/Emergencies
In a critical incident or emergency where a student is threatening suicide or displaying severe mental health problems, it may be more appropriate to contact either Security (32222), who will be able to contact the relevant emergency services, or the student's GP.Please feel free to contact us for advice or guidance if this situation arises.
Find out more about what to do in an emergency 
Helping students with mental health difficulties?
Comprehensive guidelines for recognising and helping students with Mental Health difficulties are available for all staff. This includes an easy to follow model of what kind of action to take as well as comprehensive list of internal and external support.
Mitigating Circumstances
When appropriate, Student Counselling and Wellbeing can provide a standard email to support a plea of mitigating circumstances or a email confirming attendance. Eligibility for this is detailed in our policy on mitigating circumstances below.

We do not provide psychological or medical assessments 
We cannot provide a email for students that have not had any previous therapeutic contact with the Student Counselling and Wellbeing. 
No information is given about a student without their consent. 
If you have any questions about?Student Counselling and Wellbeing's policy on providing evidence on mitigating circumstances or letters of attendance, please feel free to call the Centre and speak to the Head of Service or a core team member. Alternatively you can view our Mitigating Circumstance Policy. 

The Student Counselling and Wellbeing Policy on providing emails
Mitigating Circumstances
""Mitigating circumstances are significantly disruptive and/or unexpected events which are beyond your control (i.e. illness, bereavement) but which might affect your academic performance when submitting assessed work or sitting examinations."" 
?¡°If illness or personal difficulties have intervened during a candidature and prevented a student from progressing their research the student may be granted a suspension of registration for a period necessary to overcome the difficulties. Where such circumstances have had a significant adverse effect on the progress of the research an extension of study may be granted.¡±
?Where appropriate, counsellors will provide emails in support of mitigating circumstances where those circumstances interfered with the students' ability to focus on academic work and where the students clearly tried to manage with our help. 
  ?The following points contain information and guidelines about when we will provide this kind of email: 
  
The counsellor needs to be confident that s/he is in a position to make a judgement that the issues that the client has brought to the counselling have seriously affected his or her ability to meet course requirements. 
In order to make this kind of a judgement, the counsellor needs to have a clear awareness and understanding of the client's difficulties. 
Generally, this means that the student has attended a therapeutic consultation process or a counselling contract. 
Providing evidence of this kind for a client needs to come as a result of the counselling and not be the purpose of it. 
Emails will only ever be provided at the student's request and with the student's permission. 
The counsellor will provide a standard email which does not go into any specific details. Any mitigating circumstances letter sent by?Student Counselling and Wellbeing, will, however, state the number of sessions attended and the time period. 
Even if a counsellor has seen a student for a therapeutic consultation and several counselling sessions, s/he may not feel that providing this kind of evidence is appropriate. 
For Postgraduate research students, we provide letters confirming mitigating circumstances to support requests for supervsision/extension of study. 

Emails confirming attendance
In certain circumstances we may provide emails confirming the attendance of a student here at?Student Counselling and Wellbeing. However, the provision of an email confirming attendance is not in itself, proof of a mitigating circumstance.
Emails confirming fitness to study
We do not provide emails/letter confirming fitness to study. These letters can only be provided by a doctor.
If you have any further questions, please contact the?Head of?Student Counselling and Wellbeing,?Jane Harris:?

If modifications to the standard assessment process are necessary, the personal tutor or departmental examinations/assessments?officer should make recommendations to the Assessment & Progress Team, in consultation with the individual student and the external examiners. ?
What do students need to do?
Once students have notified us of a disability, they can review their special assessment arrangements via?Minerva?(log into Student Services, click on the ¡°Examinations¡± tab, then select ¡°Examination arrangements¡±).
Mitigating circumstances
Students should be advised to check their school's individual mitigating circumstances policy, including deadlines for each semester and where to submit the claim.?
If they are absent from an assessment or believe that their performance in an assessment has been affected by illness or other adverse circumstances, a written explanation must be provided to their parent/teaching school(s) within five working days of the assessment. In the case of illness, this must be accompanied by a full medical certificate from a doctor.
Students must submit written evidence in advance of the meeting where their results are to be considered. It's their responsibility to find out the date of this meeting - and can consult the school/departmental office. Evidence supplied after the meeting can't be taken into consideration.
Individual schools will deal with any claims, so students should seek guidance from them about what constitutes mitigating circumstances and how to complete a request.

Extensions to study period (taught postgraduate),"A standard procedure is in place for taught postgraduate students to be given extra time to complete their degree programme. This will also extend their library and IT access.
Full time taught postgraduate students are normally registered with the University for one academic session and their student record is in a single ""term"" in Banner. The maximum registration period allowed by the University is the standard duration of the programme plus two years ""top up"".?
If students need additional time to complete their programme and schools are happy to support the request, following the process below will ensure the student record is updated as appropriate.
What schools need to do
Extensions of less than four weeks
Inform the Programmes and Assessment (Operations) team via email with the new expected completion date. Operations will then update the record accordingly, no form required.
Extensions within the maximum time period
Complete an extension request form and submit it to Programmes and Assessment (Operations), ideally at least two months before the end of the student's current completion date.
A separate extension form is required for each student and each new extension (unless the new extension is for less than four weeks).? Extensions can be granted for a maximum of one academic year at a time.
Operations will then inform the relevant teams, including the Library, of the student's new expected completion date once an extension has been approved and processed. The school contact will receive an email confirming if the extension is granted at the same time.?
The record will remain in the current Banner ""term"" and only the end date will be amended if the new expected completion date is no later than the next month end i.e the term record of an October starter can be extended until the end of November.
For extensions of a greater duration that the above, Programmes and Assessment (Operations) will create a new term record for which the student will need to register for.
Extensions beyond the maximum time limit?
Once the two year ""top up"" period has elapsed, extensions can only be granted by the Student Cases team in the Secretariat.
Fees
An extension fee is applicable but it is at the School's discretion whether the fee should be charged or waived.

?
Scenarios where an extension request form is not required
The following scenarios entail the student being registered for longer than the initial study period but are not classed as extensions.
Students on ""top up"" degrees
Some programmes of study allow students to start on a PGCert or PGDip qualification and ""top up"" to a Masters degree. There are two ways in which the student record can be managed.
Continuous study
If the student is progressing from the PGCert or PGDip to the Masters programme without a gap, update Banner by using the change of programme process. Then contact Programmes and Assessment (Operations) and ask them to review and update the record as necessary in order for the student to be able to register if required.
Non-continuous study
If the School has made the award then then the student will need to reapply to the University with ""advance standing"".
?
Repeating or resitting or granted first attempts
?
Banner is updated following submission of results after exam boards via Operations being notified by the Examination team.

Caring responsibilites,"Caring responsibilities may have an impact on a student's attendance and assessment and we are committed to providing the flexibility that may be appropriate. A policy for carers gives guidance on the steps that we can take in handling any impact that this may have.
The Equality Service provides information, support and help for students who are carers. They provide guidance on the following areas:
 

A summary of the key responsibilities?
Whether a student needs to notify their school or department
The implications and impact on study

?The Policy
The policy on support for students who are parents or carers describes the University's approach to supporting students who care for children or dependent adults.??"
Autism Spectrum conditions,"Research suggests that around one person in 100 has an autism spectrum condition. Knowing how to teach and support autistic students can make a big difference.
There are a number of ways in which you can adjust teaching to help students with autism spectrum conditions?to participate effectively.?

Establish a clear line of communication to inform the student of changes in routine (for example, room changes, if a lecturer is off sick etc).
Make the links between aspects of learning explicit as generalising across contexts can sometimes be problematic. For example, students may not intuitively transfer skills learnt in one area of the programme to another area.
Accommodate different learning and thinking styles by using visual strategies and multi-sensory approaches when planning lectures and seminars.
Provide hard copies of presentation slides and information published on the VLE before taught sessions. Check that the student has received these, and that they are understood.
Ensure instructions and deadlines are very clear and assignment briefs are specific.
Consider the implications for off-site activities. The student may have difficulty using public transport, or may not be able to use it at all.
Consider giving the student permission to work alone rather than in a group. If group work is essential, help may be required with choosing partners.
Arrange frequent meetings with their personal tutor to check progress.

"
Inclusive feedback for disabled students,"The University is committed to taking an inclusive approach in all aspects of assessment and feedback

Inclusive Marking for all students
The Inclusive Marking Policy applies when marking the work of all students. This means focussing on the communication of ideas within the work, rather than on technical aspects of written language in the majority of cases.
In some disciplinary areas however, there may be genuine reasons for assessing competency in written language skill.
When designing, delivering and marking assessment, it is important to recognise that some students will be at a disadvantage here, so clarity and transparency about assessment criteria are vital. ?
Providing Feedback on Flagged work
The work of some disabled students will be ""flagged"" for marking consideration. These are students who have a?verified?diagnosis?of?a?condition which?impacts?on their writing, commonly dyslexia or another specific learning difficulty.
In some cases students with other conditions, such as a hearing or visual impairment may also have been given this recommendation by Disability Services.
As a form of reasonable adjustment under the 2010 Equality Act, it is important to acknowledge the additional needs of these students within feedback practices.
The Guidance and Checklist for providing feedback on flagged work will help you to do this.?

Guidance for providing feedback on flagged work
Checklist for providing feedback on flagged work

Inclusive Marking and Group work
Group work can be a source of anxiety for?some disabled?students as they may be reluctant to reveal areas of weakness in literacy to other group members. ?They may also be concerned that their way of working might affect the overall outcome for the group.
An inclusive approach should be taken when setting and facilitating all student group assessments.
There are?a number of?things that module tutors can do to ensure that all participants are assessed fairly. The Guidance on Inclusive Marking and Group Work will help you to understand how to do this.?

Specific Learning Difficulties ,"Approximately 4% of all university students are diagnosed with a specific learning difficulty and respond well to teaching which takes account of this.?
Each Specific Learning Difficuly (SpLD) is characterised by an unusual skills profile. This often leads to difficulties with academic tasks, despite having average or above average intelligence or general ability.
Different individuals will face very different difficulties, even with a similar SpLD diagnosis.
Many students with an SpLD may experience a visual-perceptual discomfort and disturbance which is sometimes known as Irlen Syndrome. This affects their reading of print on white paper, on overheads and slides, and use of a computer.
Stress and anxiety may also have an impact, as individual students develop and implement their own coping strategies.
There are a number of ways in which you can adjust teaching to help students with SpLDs to participate effectively.

Upload all lecture notes and other teaching materials to the virtual learning environment (VLE) in advance of lectures so students can familiarise themselves with the general content and vocabulary.
Outline the structure of each lecture clearly at the start.
Avoid unnecessary jargon or unusual grammatical constructions and, when introducing a new term, write it out and provide a definition.
Provide a written glossary of terms to explain complex terminology.
Avoid asking students to read aloud, and make sure you give plenty of time when asking students to read documents to themselves.
Provide clear, step by step, written instructions to guide students through any practical work.
Ensure you give students plenty of time to gather their thoughts before they need to give a verbal response to a question.
Design your presentation slides in an inclusive and accessible way. Use a large and clear front (such as Arial, font size 22 or larger), limit each slide to a small number of key points and use diagrams, pictures, charts and other visual aids effectively.
Read our guidance on producing accessible written and printed materials, as this will provide advice about font choice, font size, etc.
Whenever possible, design all materials (including slides, handouts, school handbooks) on a pale yellow or pale blue background. For many students, a white background creates glare and is difficult to read.
Allow plenty of opportunities for questions and feedback.
If you know of a student who has an SpLD but has not contacted Disability Services,?encourage them to contact us.

"
Disclosing disability,"The Equality Act 2010 defines a disabled person as someone who has a physical or mental impairment that has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.
The University of Leeds is committed to supporting students and staff who:

are deaf or hard of hearing 
are blind or partially-sighted 
have a physical disability, and/or mobility difficulties 
have a specific learning difficulty (for example, dyslexia or dyspraxia) 
have a developmental learning or behavioural condition (for example, AD[H]D) 
have an autism spectrum condition (for example, Asperger Syndrome) 
have a mental health condition 
have a long-term medical condition (for example, chronic fatigue syndrome, asthma, epilepsy, diabetes, cancer from the point of diagnosis, HIV) 
have a combination of these. 

How and when does the University find out about a student¡¯s disability?
Information about a student¡¯s disability is held on Banner and can be accessed by those with appropriate access. Remember that some students may choose not to disclose their disability at all.
Disclosure during the admissions process?
To enable the most appropriate support to be put in place, students are encouraged to disclose their disability when they apply to study at the University. If an applicant discloses at this stage, Disability Services?sends them information about the support they may be entitled to and the sources of funding for that support. We encourage the student to make contact with DSAS so that we can start to work with them.
If a student applies for Disabled Students' Allowance (DSA) and has an assessment of need, the school disability contact is sent a copy of the assessment. ?This can be shared with those who have responsibility for supporting that student.
If a student makes contact with DSAS and there is information that needs to be shared, with the permission of the student the Disability Coordinator will contact an appropriate person in the academic school.
Disclosure after registration?
Students can also disclose at any point during their studies by informing someone in their school or the?DSAS team. For a variety of reasons some students will choose not to disclose their disability.
If a student discloses a disability to you, you should encourage them to visit DSAS.?
Leeds undergraduate students progressing to postgraduate study?
If a student completed their undergraduate studies at Leeds and then applies for postgraduate study here, the University may have information on file about that student. This will not automatically be picked up unless the student discloses their disability during the postgraduate admissions process. ?
 "
Disability Contacts in Schools,"This page has moved! For information about the University¡¯s network of Disability Contacts, please click here.?
?
"
Funding for disabled students,"The main source of funding for disabled students from the UK is the Disabled Students' Allowance. ?
?
Disabled Students' Allowances (DSA)
DSA is funding provided to disabled students to assist with disability-related costs resulting from their programme of study and allowing them to participate fully. It is not means tested and does not need to be repaid.?Students receiving equipment through their DSA are allowed to keep that equipment when their programme has ended.
Most UK students are eligible to apply. Prospective students will have their specific needs assessed and will receive a needs assessment report.
For most students, DSA is provided by the government through Student Finance England. Students on healthcare courses will need to apply through the NHS.
Postgraduate research students who are funded by one of the Research Councils can apply for DSA. Further information is available on the Research Councils UK (RCUK) website.
Applying for DSA
The way in which students apply for and are assessed for funding differs between funding sources, as does the process for invoicing and reclaiming the cost of support.
The funding application process can take three months so applicants should be encouraged to apply as soon as possible. They do not have to have a confirmed place on a programme at the University.?
DSA provided by Student Finance England
Applicants for funding should follow the up to date guidance provided on the British Government website.?
?
?
?
DSA provided by the NHS?
Applicants to healthcare programmes should apply for DSA as part of their student bursary application. Up to date guidance and an online application system are provided on the NHS Business Services Authority website.?



DSA provided by Research Councils UK (RCUK)
Students funded by a Research Council should discuss their disability-related funding with a Disability Coordinator. Claims are submitted ona a proforma via graduate schools to the Postgraduate Scholarships Office, who are responsible for submitting applications to research councils. The deadline for submission is mid-October each year. Further information is available on the?Research Councils UK (RCUK) website.
What level of funding is available through DSA?

Funding will vary according to the results of each applicant's assessment of need, up to maximum levels which are available on the government website. These are reviewed regularly.
For undergraduate students funding is divided into allowances for specialist equipment, non-medical helpers and a general allowance.
For postgraduate students who have recently had equipment funded through DSA for an undergraduate programme, this may be deemed sufficient for further study.
Other sources of funding

Disability Services will work with students to find further sources of funding for students who either are not eligible for any of the DSA schemes or whose DSA funding does not cover the support that they need.
Encourage students to contact DSAS as soon as possible.?
Students who exceed their DSA will still receive support during their studies at Leeds.

"
Supporting disabled students,"Disability Services, schools and other services have an important role in the support provided to disabled students.
What type of support is available?
Students can access a range of support services, subject to availability and suitability, without applying for additional funding. These include:

receiving handouts and lecture presentations in advance 
access to campus-based computers with assistive technology (including text-to-speech, mind-mapping and magnification software) 
the loan of equipment (for example, digital voice recorders) 
adaptations to University accommodation 
modified examination arrangements 
extended library loans 
transcription services for eligible print-disabled students (to convert academic information into accessible formats, including braille, large print, e-text and audio) 
information and support from the Disability Services team. 

To access a range of other support services, students are likely to need to apply for additional funding, such as Disabled Students' Allowances (DSA). These services include:

one-to-one learning strategy support 
specialist mentor and/or personal assistant and/or note-taker support 
sign language interpreters. 

Support is available throughout the year, and is not restricted to University teaching terms.
Who decides what support is appropriate?
As part of the application for DSA funding, an individual needs assessment is made which looks at the student's disability and the requirements of the programme they are studying. The needs assessment is carried out at an assessment centre, such as the Leeds Assessment Centre.
A detailed report is produced following the needs assessment, which includes a list of recommendations for support and advice for academic schools.
A copy of the needs assessment report is sent to the disability contact in the student's parent school and should be made available to any colleagues who are responsible for supervising or supporting that student.
Students who are not eligible for DSA will have their support needs informally assessed by a Disability Coordinator from Disability Services. Details of any recommendations and advice for academic schools will be passed on as appropriate.
How are students supported in schools?
Each school has a disability contact who is the main link with the Disability Services team and who coordinates support for disabled students within the school.
For specific disabilities, there is some general guidance which will help schools to plan their support.

Dyslexia and other Specific Learning Difficulties
Characteristics of Specific Learning Difficulties
Each Specific Learning Difficulty (SpLD) is characterised by an uneven skills profile. This often leads to difficulties with academic tasks, despite having average or above average intelligence or general ability.
Different individuals will face very different difficulties, even with a similar SpLD diagnosis.
Many students with an SpLD may experience a visual-perceptual discomfort and disturbance which is sometimes known as Irlen Syndrome. This affects their reading of print on white paper, on overheads and slides, and use of a computer.
Stress and anxiety may also have an impact, as individual students develop and implement their own coping strategies.
Asperger Syndrome (AS) is sometimes considered to be a SpLD. However, here at Leeds, we categorise AS as an autism spectrum condition, rather than an SpLD.
What do academic schools need to do to provide equal access for a student with an SpLD?
If a student has a diagnosis of an SpLD and has approached Disability Services for support, it is likely they have had a full needs assessment and the school has received a detailed report containing specific recommendations.
There are some standard adjustments that academic schools should make in order to support students with SpLDs and these should be implemented whether or not a student has already had a needs assessment. Many of these adjustments will be beneficial to all students, including those without an SpLD.?

Provide students with module handbooks, which include a complete syllabus and reading lists, as well as guidance and information on essays, projects and other course-work. 
Make sure reading lists are available well in advance so students with SpLDs can devote more time and effort to understanding the material. 
Structure readings lists to indicate which are introductory texts and which are more advanced.? 

Further specific guidance applies to teaching and assessment.
What support do Disability Services provide?
No two people are affected by an SpLD in quite the same way. We tailor support to the individual student and work closely with academic schools to ensure the right support is in place. We offer students with SpLDs several types of support. Some of these are available without additional funding and others may be dependent on a student applying for Disabled Students Allowances (DSA) or other funding.
Services not requiring additional funding:
 

Access to campus-based computers with assistive technology (including text-to-speech, mind-mapping and magnification software). 
Loan of small items of equipment, such as recording devices. 
Modified examination arrangements, such as extra time or the use of a PC. 
Assistance in requesting copies of handouts or lecture presentations in advance. 
Extended library loan facilities, so that the student can keep library books for longer. 
Access to advice and guidance during the year, including a lunch-time drop-in service. 

Services funded through DSA or other funding sources:

Computer equipment or assistive software for the student to own. 
One-to-one strategy support, which usually involves the student spending one hour per week with a Disability Strategy Tutor to assist the student in developing academic strategies ¨C such as note-taking, time management and essay structuring. 
Transcription services (to convert printed information into accessible formats, such as braille, large print, e-text and audio).? 

We encourage prospective students to contact Disability Services as early as possible in the application process so that we can work together to ensure support is in place from the very beginning of study.
Advice for staff
Contact Disability Services for further advice about dyslexia or other specific learning difficulties (SpLDs), or to discuss the needs of a particular student.?
Asperger Syndrome
Asperger Syndrome (AS) is an autism spectrum condition which is not uncommon; research suggests that around 1 person in 100 has AS. The University aims to provide equal access to learning to students with AS.
What do academic schools need to do to provide equal access for a student with AS?
If a student has a diagnosis of AS and has approached Disability Services for support, it is likely that they have had a needs assessment and the school has received a detailed report containing specific recommendations.
There are some standard adjustments that academic departments should make in order to support a student with AS and these should be implemented whether or not the student has had a needs assessment.
 

Check pre-programme literature: use clear and unambiguous language. 
Send a book list (with core texts clearly indicated) to the student in advance of their arrival. 
Invite the student to meet at least one academic member of the programme team before the course starts ¨C staff should clarify their role and provide clear boundaries and guidelines for contact. 
Contact Disability Services as soon as possible for guidance and support. 
Send the student information about what the first day of school induction will be like and offer support to help them engage with the activities. 
Assist the student with familiarisation with the school, including student facilities and key staff. 
Identify a quiet place for retreat ¨C students with AS often find noisy environments overwhelming which can lead to anxiety. 
Identify where the student can go for help with course-related issues ¨C again, set clear boundaries and guidelines for contact.? 

Further specific guidance applies to teaching and assessment.
What support do Disability Services provide?
No two people are affected by AS in quite the same way and the specific characteristics of the condition can vary enormously. We tailor support to the individual student and work closely with academic schools to ensure the right support is in place. We offer students with AS several types of support. Some of these are available additional funding and others may be dependent on a student applying for Disabled Students Allowances (DSA) or other funding.
Services not requiring additional funding:

Support from a named Disability Coordinator who has specific responsibility for supporting students with Asperger Syndrome. 
Assistance with the application process for obtaining Disabled Students Allowances, where relevant. 
Creation of an Asperger Syndrome-specific Transitional Learning Contract to assist the student in making the transition from school or college to university. 
Assistance in negotiating special arrangements for examinations. 
Liaison with the student¡¯s department to ensure that any necessary adjustments are made to the methods of learning, teaching and assessment. 
Liaison with the University Library to agree additional borrowing rights. 

Services funded through DSA or other funding sources:

Regular study strategy support sessions with an independent specialist in AS ¨C these sessions are aimed at helping the student develop long-term strategies to cope with their condition whilst at the University. 
Support from a specialist mentor, who will assist the student with his/her general organisation, work planning, time-management and revision. Mentors can also act as the student¡¯s assistant in getting about campus, taking notes in lectures and using the library. A key element of the mentor role is in assisting the student in communicating with their department or with other University services 
Assistive equipment, which may include a laptop, printer, internet connection or digital voice recorder ¨C training is offered where needed 

We encourage prospective students to contact Disability Services as early as possible in the application process so that we can work together to ensure support is in place from the very beginning of study.?
Advice and training for staff
Contact Disability Services for further advice about autism spectrum conditions and Asperger syndrome, or to discuss the needs of a particular student.

Disability Services support and guidance sessions
Students do not need to be referred to Disability Services. There are two ways they can make direct contact, in person by visiting?Disability Services in Chemistry West.
Drop-in sessions
Drop-in sessions take place on week days from 9.30 until 4pm. Information will be provided regarding accessing support such as exam arrangements, study skills and mobility support. Advice will also be provided regarding Disabled Students' Allowance.
Students attending a drop-in may then be referred for a guidance appointment to discuss their concern in greater detail.
Guidance appointments
Guidance sessions take place daily during term time.
Students have a 25-minute session with a Disability Coordinator. These sessions should be booked through Disability Services reception. Appointments can be made on 0113 343 3927 and disability@leeds.ac.uk"
SUPPORT FOR DISABLED INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS,"The University welcomes?disabled international students and can offer support, advice and guidance.
Our Disability Services team is?one of the largest in the UK, with a range of specialist staff members working to support disabled students.
Disabled international students should register with Disability Services to access a wide range of free support, for example:

modified examination arrangements
equipment loan, if available
extended library loans
disabled students early induction programme
accessibility within IT computer clusters
transcription for eligible print-disabled students.

In addition, additional forms of support may be available through external funding such as Disabled Students¡¯ Allowances or bursaries. Eligbility for this funding depends on an international student¡¯s course and nationality. More information on this funding can be found on our dedicated disabled international students page.
We understand that applying for this funding can be complex. Disabled international students are warmly encouraged to contact Disability Services on disability@leeds.ac.uk with any questions.
Short-term support for disabled international students
The Disabled Students?Access Fund?is open to applications from all disabled students and pays for support?for non-academic related activities.??
Examples of the support that this funding may be provided for include:

if a student has just arrived at the University and requires support to access essential facilities such as a bank, supermarket or other facilties
if a student?requires someone to accompany them to?a club, society or recreational facility for the first time?
to support participation in an activity that is relevant to a student¡¯s?course of study where reasonable adjustments by the provider will not fully address their support needs.

Giving immigration advice to individuals is regulated by the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner (OISC) so only staff specifically trained for this are permitted to give immigration advice. ?Giving general information and signposting to websites is not classed as immigration advice and can be done by all staff.
When to refer a student
If a student may need immigration advice related to their situation, unless urgent, direct them to the relevant website in the first instance where they can find initial information and advice and then contact the Student Visa Advice team with any specific questions.?

Applicant and offer holder immigration information is on the visas and immigration section of www.leeds.ac.uk/international ?

immigration restrictions related to resits, suspension, withdrawal and part-time study
immigration issues for dependants and visitors.

Miscellaneous Research Students
If you are inviting a student to the UK for a period of miscellaneous research, you can find the relevant visa information on our visas for research and study visits?page. Staff can contact the Student Visa Advice team ?with questions needed to ensure that the University remains compliant with our legal responsibilities.
?
Student Immigration Compliance
As the holder of a licence to sponsor international students for a Student Route visa, the University of Leeds has to comply with a range of requirements, For example we are required to report student to the UK Visas & Immigration section of the Home Office in the following circumstances:

failure to register
poor attendance
withdrawal from course
suspensions for longer than 60 days
extensions to end dates
early completion of course
changes of courses or programmes.

"Confidentiality, disclosure and data protection","The University takes issues relating to confidentiality, disclosure and data protection seriously. Staff should be aware of their responsibility to respect the right of others to confidentiality.
Confidentiality??
It takes courage for students to talk to us about their private and personal lives. We have a duty to keep information confidential unless there's a reason to share it: in most situations we need to ask permission to do so.?The Student Privacy Notice?lists reasons why we may share personal information about students with colleagues at the University who have a business reason to know, and, in some circumstances, with external organisations.
Our commitment to students is that:

Any information given to us will be stored securely.
We may share information with other staff within the university, where required for operational purposes.
Some staff within our more specialist teams receive regular clinical supervision; if a staff member discusses a student in the context of their work, they will do so without revealing the student's identity.
We will normally ask for consent before sharing any information about a student with third parties such as their GP, other mental health workers,and agencies and professionals outside the University.
We may disclose student information without consent to third parties such as a medical professional or the police service where we have genuine concerns relating to the safety of a student or others, as permitted within Data Protection Law.?
 
We always ask that the people we share student information with demonstrate due respect for confidentiality.?
Unless otherwise agreed with the student, a disabled student¡¯s sensitive information can be released within the University only for the assessment and provision of services as described in the student contract.?

Family members
We do not normally discuss students with their parents or guardians, partners or other family members. We may occasionally provide family members with general information relating to the types of support we offer but we will not share information about a student unless we have permission to do so. The decision to share would always be made in consultation with the student involved.

Legal grounds for breaking confidentiality
If a student discloses information which you believe may have implications for safeguarding, national security, prevention or detection of a crime or the prosecution of an offender you should seek advice from the University legal adviser, Adrian Slater, before acting on the information.
"
Student Information Service,"The Student Information Service is a first point of contact for students with any questions relating to studying at the University of Leeds.
There are three main strands to the service that colleagues can direct students to:

A helpline staffed from 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday. Students can call from inside the UK on 0800 915 0402 or from outside the UK on +44 (0)113 343 7000
An email address ¨C?studentinfo@leeds.ac.uk. We aim to respond to all enquiries within a 24 hour period.
Four physical information points open 10am to 4pm, Monday to Friday across campus at Worsley; Marjorie and Arnold Ziff; Maurice Keyworth; and the Sir William Henry Bragg buildings.

Student ambassadors work alongside the on-campus teams to offer students information and support on campus, to answer their questions, find out what they need to know or connect them to the right teams and services.

Student Information Service locations on Leeds campus

Student Information Service opening times and contact information are available for students to view on the For Students website. We would appreciate colleagues directing students to SIS via their channels of communication using this information. The helpline often remains open on University closed days (excluding bank holidays). This information is regularly updated on the holidayinfo?page of the For Students website.?
The Student Information Service team
The Student Information Service team is made up of five permanent SIS advisors, three supervisors, a project officer, three managers and a Business Lead. We also have 15 advisors from the SES who work across our Student Information Points and the helpline and we also have advisors who are current students. We welcome further SES involvement, particularly in busy periods such as September. If you are interested in getting involved, please contact studentinfo@leeds.ac.uk.?
New enquiry management platform?
In 2022, SIS will be moving to a new enquiry management tool, which is part of Dynamics 365, Microsoft¡¯s suite of planning and customer relationship management applications. This will enable better tracking of enquiries, improve analysis of activity and develop a database of information.?
In turn this will allow staff to respond more effectively and consistently. Students will benefit from faster and more accurate responses.?
How we support other teams
The SIS deals with a range of enquiries from admissions to graduation, as well as registration queries and official transcript request enquiries. We have been working with various teams across the University to support workload in relation to student facing email inboxes. This includes providing training for team members to triage general enquriy emails for forwarding directly to the SIS email inbox for a response.?
If you would like to know more about this or think it is something your team could benefit from, then don¡¯t hesitate to email Jess Christie j.r.christie@leeds.ac.uk.
The Knowledge Base
In order to provide consistent, informed responses about a range of queries from our students, the SIS has created a Knowledge Base with over 600 entries collated from teams from across the University. To check, edit or contribute to information related to the service provision of your team, please contact studentinfo@leeds.ac.uk.
Further Information
If you have any questions about the Student Information Service, please contact studentinfo@leeds.ac.uk.

Induction for postgraduate researchers,"A good induction can help PGRs settle in quickly and begin to make early progress with their research.
Postgraduate researchers are provided with a PGR handbook which brings together key rules, regulations and guidance which form the framework of the degree. Copies of the handbook are available on the Doctoral College Minerva organisation or from your faculty Graduate School.??
The handbook includes:

the University's Code of practice for research degree candidatures

There is also the opportunity to meet many other new postgraduate researchers.
Students are notified of forthcoming welcome events by email, with an invitation to register online.
Information provided by schools and faculties
Schools should provide students with any local information about the administrative and academic arrangements for undertaking research within that school or faculty. This could include:

information on the specific facilities that are available to PGRs
relevant health and safety advice
opportunities for participating in conferences
information about social and extra-mural activities

You may also provide information about the training that is available through OD&PL.
Information provided by the International Student Office

Academic Personal tutoring,"Academic Personal Tutoring has a crucial role to play throughout a student¡¯s time at University and beyond. Guiding students through welcome, induction and subsequent re-orientation at the start of each academic stage. Helping students to maximise their success and enabling them to feel part of the vibrant academic community in their School.
The University¡¯s values, and our commitment to the Leeds Partnership and the ethos of Leeds for Life, underpin all aspects of Personal Tutoring.
The core purposes of an Academic Personal Tutor are to:?
??? ?contribute to maximising student success?
??? ?help students to feel part of a learning community by developing a sense of belonging. This will be through regular contact and development of a professional and supportive relationship
??? ?assist students in regularly reviewing their academic progress. This includes supporting and encouraging the development of independent learning skills
??? ?encourage students to reflect on their learning, both within and beyond the formal curriculum, and how it contributes to their future development and career. This includes signposting and support to enable involvement in co-curricular opportunities
??? ?support students¡¯ personal and professional development through providing initial advice and signposting to appropriate careers guidance?and related opportunities and services?
??? ?provide initial pastoral support for their tutees and refer students to support services in the School, Faculty and University, with some ongoing pastoral support if appropriate to the School context. ?

Each School has an Academic Personal Tutor Lead. Details of School based Welcome, Induction and Transition activity are available online.?
?
Training and Resources
University of Leeds staff can self-enrol onto a Minerva organisation containing policy documents, training materials and resources. These offer further guidance and support to help you to undertake and reflect on the role of Academic Personal Tutor at Leeds. In addition, there are a number of video-based scenarios highlighting common challenges facing tutors, accompanied by commentary on how you might respond in each case.?
Access the organisation and follow the on-screen instructions to self-enrol.?
In addition, bespoke sessions can be organised on request within Schools and Faculties. For further information, please email academicdev@leeds.ac.uk

Student Wellbeing??
There are many ways we can help support student wellbeing. Allowing students the chance to have a conversation with you about how they are feeling and using empathy and active listening skills is a great start. Sometimes this may result in helping students to navigate policies and processes; helping them to identify and resolve challenges or problems; or may mean referring them to specialist support services either within or outside the university.? We have different options within the University that you might recommend to your tutees.?
Student Counselling and Wellbeing?
Our Student Counselling and Wellbeing service offers professional support from Counsellors, Mental Health Advisors and Wellbeing Practitioners through individual appointments, group workshops and self-help resources. Students will need to complete the online self-referral form in order to receive an appointment.?

You may find the Crisis Pathway helpful in deciding where to direct a student in crisis.??
The University also works with Big White Wall, an anonymous, online 24/7 peer and professional support tool, supported by trained counsellors. This is free to all University of Leeds students and staff when they sign up with their university email address.??

Student Finance and Hardship Support
Student Finance and Hardship Support ¨C Personal Tutors?
The majority of students at the University of Leeds receive some form of financial support.? For most students funding will be received as expected, and this together with other sources of income, such as paid work, will provide sufficient income to support them throughout their studies.? Unfortunately for some students this is not the case and from time to time they may experience funding issues or find themselves in unexpected financial hardship.? If you become aware of students in such a situation they should be referred to the Funding Team, who specialise in all aspects of student finance, and will therefore be able to provide the necessary support and guidance.?
Student Finance and Hardship Support ¨C Tutees?
The Student Funding team is responsible for the administration of student financial support at the University of Leeds.? This includes, but is not limited to: awarding and paying Leeds Financial Support (LFS); receiving and assessing applications for the Leeds Hardship Fund (LHF) and the International Leeds Hardship Fund (ILHF); communicating with and reporting to the Student Loans Company to enable payment of student maintenance loans and tuition fee loans, and administering US Federal Loans.? If you are experiencing financial problems, find yourself in unexpected financial hardship or simply have a funding query you should contact the Funding Team who will be able to provide you with the necessary information, support and guidance.?

Mitigating circumstances,"Mitigating circumstances are normally exceptional, short term, unforeseen and unpreventable events that have a significantly disruptive effect on the student¡¯s ability to take assessments.? These events are over and above the course of everyday life and normally outside of their control.? The events may affect the student¡¯s ability to complete coursework or other assessments and revise for and attend on-campus assessments.??
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF???
Mitigating Circumstances?is the umbrella term used by the University of Leeds for the process by which students can seek mitigation for the impact on their ability to complete assessments.?
Students may allude to circumstances that have affected their studies?via their?Academic?Personal Tutor or School Student Support Officer, but this is not sufficient to enable these circumstances to be taken into consideration. There is a formal procedure to follow, a deadline to meet and evidence required to support such claims. If one of your students does mention adverse circumstances that appear to have affected their studies, then this should act as a trigger for you to discuss the formal?Mitigating?Circumstances?process with the student.?
As the onus is on the student to make and evidence the claim for mitigation, then part of your role as an?Academic Personal Tutor?or as a member of the?Student Education Service may be to encourage the student to follow the formal process to ensure that any such circumstances are considered by their Parent?school's?Special Circumstances Committee.??However, it would not be your role to pre-empt or pre-judge the outcomes of such a?Committee, but to advise the student regarding the process.?
There are two routes of mitigation available: ¡®Extensions to Coursework Deadlines¡¯?and ¡®Additional Consideration¡¯.?
Please see the?Mitigating Circumstances Guidance 2021-2022?(Word) for full details, including how?students?apply for an?Extension to a Coursework Deadline?or?Additional Consideration.?
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES OR LONG-TERM HEALTH CONDITIONS?
Disabled?students, or?students with?a long-term health condition (12 months or more) that impacts on?their?day-to-day activities, should register with Disability Services who will advise further on support and reasonable adjustments to?their?study and assessment.? Disability includes Specific Learning Difficulties (such as dyslexia and dyspraxia), as well as diagnosed mental health conditions.?
IF THE STUDENT DOES NOT SIT THEIR ASSESSMENTS AND DOES NOT MAKE AN APPLICATION FOR MITIGATION?
The students are expected to contact their schools to let them know what is happening.??If they do not submit an assessment and do not apply for mitigation they may be withdrawn from their studies.?
If the student is unable to contact their school at any stage, it is important that they get in touch with their school again, as soon as possible.?
In extreme cases, where there is evidence to show that there were circumstances beyond the student¡¯s control which prevented them for contacting their school, a retrospective application for mitigating circumstances may be considered.?
WHAT DO STUDENTS NEED TO DO???
All taught undergraduate and postgraduate students wishing?to?apply for?mitigating circumstances, need to complete?a?Mitigating Circumstances form?and provide supporting evidence?to?their Parent School, even if the module affected is taken in a different school.?
See the?student?pages?for more information about mitigating circumstances.??
WHERE CAN STAFF FIND MORE INFORMATION???
Staff should visit the?Mitigating?Circumstances?web page for more information.??

Staff-student relationship,"It is important that University procedures are followed if a staff-student relationship breaks down or if a close personal relationship develops between a member of staff and a student.
Breakdown of the staff-student relationship
There are occasions where the relationship between a student and their personal tutor, supervisor or another key member of staff breaks down. We strive to create an environment of mutual respect but anyone who feels they have been a victim of bullying, harassment or victimisation can refer to the Policy on dignity and mutual respect for guidance on what to do next. If a member of staff or a student feels they have not been treated fairly in terms of equality or inclusion, this policy has further information.
If the relationship breaks down to the point where a student makes a complaint, the student complaints procedure should be followed.
Close personal relationships
The University's Policy on close personal relationships with students states that a member of staff who becomes involved in such a relationship must declare it to a senior colleague or to a third party designated by the Director of Human Resources."
Student Support Functional Management Team,"The team leads the development and delivery of processes relating to student support and brings together specialists from across the University.
Functional managers from faculties and colleagues from relevant central teams work together to develop practice to ensure that students are provided with high-quality support services and consistent advice from University colleagues.

peer mentoring,"Leeds for Life model for Peer Mentoring provides a set of principles to establish the minimum requirements to enable student mentors to have their engagement with the scheme formally recognised by the University on their Higher Education Achievement Record (HEAR).
The aims of the Leeds for Life model for Peer Mentoring are:
 

To assist a smooth transition to different stages of University study by giving students the opportunity to meet with current students who have previously transitioned through the relevant stage;
To enable peer mentors to develop a range of Leeds for Life skills and knowledge to help fellow students transition to or through University life.
To help new students feel an early sense of belonging to their peer group, school and the University.
To articulate with personal tutoring by providing an additional source of support for students to go for information and assistance.

And in the spirit of the University Partnership:
 

To recognise the value of those who have recently transitioned into Higher Education in contributing to developing an excellent supportive environment.

The principles set baseline expectations but allow for school variations in the design and implementation of such schemes. The principles approach ensures that the selection and training of peer mentors, the monitoring of their engagement with the scheme and the graduate level skills they derive through their engagement are robust and consistent.
The principles of the Leeds for Life model of Peer Mentoring are:
 

There should be School-level commitment and approval for the scheme with named administrative support identified to co-ordinate the scheme at a School level;
Peer Mentor Co-ordinators should undertake appropriate induction for setting up such a scheme, such as attendance at a Train the Trainer event;
Peer Mentors should be provided with a role description that includes clear boundaries;
Students should signal their interest in becoming a Peer Mentor via a selective application process;?
All applications should be independently scrutinised and there must be clear and transparent selection criteria to determine the suitability of those wishing to become Peer Mentors;
All Peer Mentors must receive appropriate training for their role, to include guidance on signposting and reporting in relation to duty of care, and attendance at the training must be recorded;
Evidence of Peer Mentors engagement with the scheme must be gained e.g. through monitoring and/or timetabling;
Peer Mentors engagement with the scheme must be maintained for a period of 6 ¨C 12 weeks over the first semester of the academic year with a minimum number of substantive contacts or encounters with tutees being defined;
That supervision be provided to Peer Mentors in order to respond to complex or affecting pastoral issues.

Through their engagement with the scheme Peer Mentors should have opportunity to develop the following graduate level skills:
 

Use of Knowledge ¨C demonstrated through using knowledge of the programme of study to answer questions and provide advice / insight into being a student on the programme ;?
Professionalism - demonstrated through acting as a role model to incoming students and being selected on the basis of having a good attitude towards their own studies;
Time management - demonstrated through the planning and organisation of meetings and events;
Team working - demonstrated through working effectively in partnership with a fellow mentor and together with their mentees;
Social / cultural sensitivity - demonstrated through being aware of student diversity and in organising events that are inclusive;
Communication skills - demonstrated through listening, signposting, passing on information and knowledge, offering different perspectives plus being supportive and encouraging;
Confidence - peer mentors need to build the confidence and self-reliance of incoming students and therefore would need to demonstrate these qualities themselves through leading discussions with peers;
Ethical awareness - demonstrated through acting in an ?open and honest way and with integrity in relation to academic regulations;
Flexibility - able to respond to issues as they arise and to be resourceful in organising events and discussions with incoming students;
Leadership - demonstrated through leading events, activities and discussion with a group of up to 10 incoming students;
 
Peer Mentors should not receive direct payment for their involvement in the scheme, although the design of the scheme should enable their contribution to be recognised via the HEAR.
Certificates for those Peer Mentors who have engaged successfully with the scheme should be provided. 

There does remain the option to introduce less formal schemes for peer support but it would not be expected that these would be recognised via the HEAR.
Peer Mentoring Policy?

The Leeds for Life Peer Mentoring policy was approved by TSEB in February 2015, and provides a set of principles to establish the minimum requirements to enable student mentors to have their engagement with the scheme formally recognised by the University on their HEAR.

Religious observance,"Our institutional timetable is set to accommodate religious observance where possible. Sometimes issues feel or become more complex at an individual school or service level.
What students need to do?
Students who, for religious reasons, are unable to carry out their university work on a Sabbath or a holy day must advise their school(s) immediately. ?
Where a student's religious commitments prevent them from taking exams on certain days during University assessment periods, they must also?give notice to the Assessment & Progress Team by completing?the?Notification of religious commitments form?by?the last Friday in October for January assessments and by the end of Week 4 of teaching in semester 2 for May/June assessments (see the timeline).
Where exemption is approved, it is the student¡¯s responsibility to ensure they have covered all work from classes that they have missed.
The University will make every effort to avoid arranging assessments on a Sabbath or holy day for those students who have informed the Assessment & Progress Team as required. The University, however, reserves the right to hold assessments?on such days if no alternative time is convenient.?

Viewing the timetable
Every version of the assessment timetable is forwarded to each school and also appears online.
Students can access their personal assessment timetable on the Student Services website available via Minerva.
It is a student's responsibility to consult the timetables, raise any queries or concerns with their school and make adequate preparations to attend the assessments. Each timetable shows:

date of assessment
start time of assessment
duration of assessment
title of assessment (module code and short title)
(applies to final timetable only and in the event that the assessment is to take place on campus) assessment location (building name and room number).

Where a school has queries or concerns with the data contained in the timetables, these should be emailed immediately to examinationtimetable@leeds.ac.uk.
Where a clash is identified, students must notify the Assessment & Progress?Team immediately, who will then try to alter the timetable. Where the clash is unavoidable, advice on necessary procedures will be provided (see below).
?
Aims in timetabling
The timetable for online assessments will differ to the timetable for on-campus assessments.? See Timetable FAQs for help regarding the timetable for online assessments.
When producing a timetable, the Assessment & Progress?Team aims to schedule all University assessments so that each candidate is able to attend all assessments in their programme of study, where
(i) assessment clashes are avoided and provision for clashes is made where a clash occurs and the timetable cannot be altered;
(ii) for on-campus assessments, a direct succession of three or more assessments?is avoided (where such a continuum includes afternoon to next morning);
(iii) for on-campus assessments, a direct succession of three-hour papers is avoided;
(iv) exams during a Sabbath or a holy day are avoided where possible for candidates who have given notice to the Assessment & Progress Team of?their religious commitments on those dates;
(v) for health or access reasons, exams are held in a designated room for candidates who have been approved as requiring attendance in such a room for exam purposes.
Where any of the above is not arranged in a timetable, the Assessment & Progress Team should be contacted immediately. Every effort will be made to schedule assessments as indicated above, but the University reserves the right to hold assessments as per a ¡®best fit¡¯ timetable if no alternatives can be arranged.
?
Draft timetable
A draft timetable is usually published prior to the assessment period (though this is not always the case) and indicates proposed dates and times of assessments for examined modules.
It is important that both schools and students check the draft timetable and inform the Assessment & Progress?Team of any issues and concerns prior to the final version of the timetable being published for the forthcoming assessment period.
?
The final version and the timetable with venues
Following any feedback received relating to the draft timetable, a final version of the timetable is published.? For dates see the published timeline.
For assessments which will take place on-campus, the timetable with venues is published a few weeks later. From this time, students' personal assessment timetables will include the room name and the allocated seat number for each assessment.
?
Assessment periods?
Assessments may be held on any of the days within the published assessment period, and students must be available for full duration of each assessment period. Students can view their personal assessment timetable via Minerva, through Student Services?using the Examinations tab.
Separate timetables may be issued at school level: for example, in the schools of Medicine, Dentistry or Healthcare, or for certain Cohorts.? Time slots?for specific assessments within the published duration?(such as speaking assessments or performances) will?be confirmed by the school.
?
Assessment times
Assessment session times may vary, but ordinarily for on-campus asssessments are as follows:

Morning exams - 9am to 12 noon?
Afternoon exams - 2pm to 5pm

"
Assessment papers,"For the academic year 2021/22, there is an expectation that most assessment will be online (i.e. digital and electronic submissions).? However, some assessments will necessarily need to take place on campus (e.g. performances, laboratory work, etc.).
Staff should visit the Process Management SharePoint site to retrieve templates for Online Time Limited Assessment (48 hours or less) and/or the?paper-based?assessment question paper templates.? Please note staff will be required to login to this site using their University of Leeds username and password.??If you are unsure of how to access the site staff members should contact their Functional Manager.
Once on the site, you will be able to access the Process document which clearly shows the different templates.? You will also be able to access the Preparation of Assessment Papers and Online Time Limited Assessments with a duration of 48 Hours or Less Guidance which gives full and clear information on the differences of each of the templates and the requirements of information which each template should display.? As well as some useful tips on inclusive language and format.
Staff must ensure that the Assessment Approval process (also available on the Process Management SharePoint site) is?carried out thoroughly before submitting online time-limited assessments to the School SES and assessment papers to Assessment?& Progress?Team (A&P).
Guidelines for submission of Online Time Limited assessments
Papers can be submitted by email to the school SES team. Online Time Limited Assessments should be converted to PDF files prior to being emailed to ensure that formatting is preserved.? Formatting issues, which may not be spotted until the assessment, could arise if assessments are submitted in any other file types such as Word documents.
Guidelines for submission of assessment papers
For any on-campus assessments, the?assessment papers must be submitted to A&P by the deadlines published in the timeline.
Papers can be submitted by email. Papers should be converted to PDF files prior to being emailed to ensure that formatting is preserved.? Formatting issues, which may not be spotted until the exam, could arise if papers are submitted in any other file types such as Word documents.
Diagrams
Diagrams should be submitted in black ink.

Revised assessment papers

If it becomes necessary to submit a revised assessment?paper, schools are asked to clearly mark the new paper ""Version 2"" alongside the module code. The invigilator may also be asked to make an announcement before the start of the assessment to ensure all candidates have the correct version of the paper.
Where an amendment to an assessment?paper has to be made at the start of or during an assessment, this information must be relayed to the nearest A&P sub-office. The relevant details will then be reported to all students sitting the assessment?in Special Circumstances.
Any paper that is found to have an error and requires re-printing will be done so at a financial cost to the school.
External examiner¡¯s comments
Where an external examiner's comments are required, schools are reminded not to transmit proposed papers or the examiner's comments by fax. Papers should not be submitted for printing until final approval by the external examiner has been confirmed. Please make sure the approved Online Time Limited Assessments are submitted to the school SES team and assessment papers are still submitted to?A&P by the deadline.?
August?resit assessment?papers
Schools are asked to provide August resit papers as soon after the semester 2 assessment period as possible, but no later than the published deadline (see the deadline?published in the timeline).
Resit papers will be not be made available to students after the assessments.?
Special resit papers
Where the syllabus for a module has changed and a student resitting the module requires a paper for the earlier syllabus, a special paper must be provided. It is the school's responsibility to inform?A&P?of this necessity on the assessment schedule.?
Past assessment?papers
Past assessment papers from 2003 onwards are available online. Schools should indicate at the time of submitting the paper to A&P?those papers that should not be made available to students after the assessment. These will then be printed on pink paper. As in previous years, and unless otherwise requested, all August re-assessment papers and multiple-choice question papers will not be made available to students after the assessments.? Where an online time limited assessment (48 hours or less) has taken place and the schools wish for these to be included on the Past assessment papers page, the school should supply A&P with a copy of the paper (PDF format).
In July/August each year, schools will be sent a list of exam papers from that year which have been identified as being suitable for publishing online. Schools are asked to confirm that the papers may be released on the web and to send electronic versions of the papers, which can be uploaded to the?Past assessment?papers page. These papers will then be made available online from October/November.
"
On the day,"For on campus assessments, there are procedures in place to help deal with any unusual or special circumstances that may arise on the day of an assessment.
Admission to the assessment room
Students must bring their student ID card to each assessment?as well as necessary writing implements and any other required materials (as advised by the school). No unauthorised materials can be taken into the assessment room.

Students will have been notified of their allocated seat number for each assessment on the personal assessment timetable available online. Seating lists will also be posted outside each venue to allow students to look up their seat number if they don't already know it. Invigilators will allow students to enter the room a few minutes before the start of the assessment. Students must sit in the seat allocated to them.
Students arriving within 60 minutes after the start of an assessment will be admitted to the room and allowed to sit the assessment, although they will not be permitted extra time.?

Identification in assessments

A University student ID card is the only form of identification accepted for assessments. Students without a University ID card will be allowed to sit the assessment, however, their details will be recorded and an identification check will be carried out on the student in the venue (this may require the student to remain in the venue after the assessment has finished). If they attempt to attend further assessments without their card, they may be excluded from that assessments. Students will need to know their student ID number as this is required to complete each script book.
Procedures and requirements during an assessment


Invigilators will instruct and monitor students on assessment procedures and requirements. Where a student has a concern, they should raise a hand and wait for assistance but must not leave their seat.
During an assessment, students must not:

speak
communicate with other students
copy another student's notes
refer to any unauthorised material or text.

Mobile phones and other electronic communications equipment must be switched off, with all preset alarms disabled and placed in the plastic bags provided on the desks. Any phones or pagers will be confiscated if found on a student or on or near their desk during the assessment, and its presence may be regarded as cheating.

Departure from the assessment room is not permitted during the first hour or the last 10 minutes of the allocated time. Where temporary leave from the room is required, a student must be accompanied by an invigilator. Candidates who wish to leave the room before the end of the assessment are required to raise their hand to ask permission. They should not be permitted to leave until the invigilator is satisfied that a script book has been completed. The invigilator must also note on the top of the script book the time the candidate left. If more than one script book has been completed, these should be fastened together with a treasury tag. Penalties apply where any of these are not observed.
It was agreed by the Taught Student Education Board that:

No assessments?should be postponed in the event of a delay greater than 30 minutes.
The module leader/member of the teaching team should attend the assessment venue(s) at least 10 minutes before the assessment starts and for the first 10 minutes of the assessment.*
A contact telephone number will be provided against every assessment paper to ensure that queries (arising after the first 10 minutes) can be managed.

* Academic staff are not required to attend any part of the August re-assessment period or to be on stand-by to deal with assessment?related queries, though one or the other would be helpful.?


Use of dictionaries during assessments
Candidates are only allowed to take a dictionary into the assessment if it is specifically stated on the rubric of the assessment paper (the instructions on the front of the assessment paper) that it is permitted.? Students should check with their Module Leader before the assessment whether or not they are permitted to use a dictionary in that assessment.
Module Leaders should ensure that if a translation dictionary is required to complete the assessment that they instruct their students accordingly on the regulation.?
Where a dictionary is permitted, it must not be annotated, augmented or otherwise altered in any way apart from the inclusion of the owner's name inside the front cover. Annotations include, for example, notes (including single words), cross-references, highlighted text or underlined text. Any annotation other than the owner's name on the inside cover will be considered an attempt to introduce an 'unauthorised' item into the assessment room under the Cheating, Plagiarism, Fraudulent or Fabricated Coursework and Malpractice in University Examinations and Assessments Regulations
Students are responsible for the dictionary they bring to the assessment. To claim it is borrowed or second hand will not be an acceptable defence.
Electronic translators are not permitted.
All venues will be supplied with a basic English Language Dictionary that students may request to use by raising their hand and speaking to the Invigilator during the assessment.?
Emergencies during an assessment
Invigilators will instruct students where any emergency issues arise. Invigilators have permission to allow an extra 10 minutes of assessment?time for students to regain concentration after a substantial interruption. The Assessment & Progress Manager or Officer must be informed if any extra time has been given. More extra time may only be allowed with the approval of the Assessment & Progress?Manager or Officer. Details of procedures are available in the Operational guide for invigilation?(PDF).
Leaving an assessment
Candidates are not permitted to leave an assessment in the first 60 or last 10 minutes. An invigilator will let candidates know when there is 10 minutes assessment time remaining and then call an end to each assessment when the time is up. At this point, students must stop writing and remain quietly in their seat while all answer books are collected. Assessment papers printed on white may be taken away by the student, however all other assessment papers, which are the property of the University, must be left in the assessment room. Students are not permitted to remove script books from the room and must remain seated until all scripts have been collected and the invigilator announces that they are free to leave.
Absence from an assessment

Where a student does not or cannot attend an assessment, he or she should immediately inform their parent and teaching schools. Evidence supporting the absence, such as a medical certificate, must be included. Unless exceptional reasons prevail, notification submitted after five working days after an assessment period will not be considered.

Special circumstances room
A special circumstances room is available for students with particular study concerns such as a disability or health problem or unavoidable clash.
Students who have a disability or health problems and require location in the special circumstances room will normally have the prior approval of their school and the Leeds Student Medical Practice or the Disabilities Adviser. Such students will be advised of special procedures by the Assessment & Progress?Team (A&P).
In the case of an unavoidable clash, the student will be advised of special procedures by A&P. This will involve sitting both of the clashing papers in the special circumstances room.
Illness during an assessment
If a candidate is ill during the assessment, they will have the following options:

Taking a few minutes out and carrying on when they feel better, but with no extra time.
Going to the special circumstances room and getting the rest of time in full once they feel well enough to continue.
Stopping completely and applying to resit - they must get a doctor¡¯s note to cover their illness if they wish consideration to be given to that re-assessment counting as a first attempt.

If a candidate does not wish to continue in the main assessment room, the invigilator will take them to the nearest A&P?sub-office with their paper and script books, unless the nature of the illness prevents such.
Where health permits, the student may then be able to continue the assessment in the special circumstances room with extra time as appropriate.
In all cases, the circumstances will be reported to A&P and the appropriate school.
Specific instructions to invigilators for students in distress are available in the Operational guide for invigilation?(PDF).
Late arrival
If a student arrives within the first 60 minutes of an assessment, they will be admitted but will not be allowed any extra time. They will be asked to complete a Late Arrivals form giving their reason for lateness and this will be sent to the school for consideration during marking and moderation and will assist in any decisions about the award of first attempts. Examiners may also take the decision not to accept the reasons for the late arrival and award a grade of AB for the assessment concerned.
If a student arrives after the first 60 minutes of an assessment, they will be escorted to the main A&P sub-office where, in consultation with A&P, a decision will be made as to whether the circumstances leading to the late arrival are sufficiently serious and beyond the student's control to justify them being granted permission to start the assessment late. If permission is granted, a decision will also be made regarding the arrangements under which the assessment will be conducted. Examiners may take the decision not to accept the reasons for the late arrival and award a grade of AB for the assessment concerned.
If a student arrives after the assessment has finished, they will not be permitted to take the assessment under any circumstances and will be recorded as absent for that assessment.
Adverse weather conditions
In the event of adverse weather, it should be assumed that assessments will continue as timetabled. Where a student claims to be affected by such conditions, this information should be registered within both the school and the Assessment & Progress Team?as soon as possible?after the missed assessment(s) and where claims are verified, special arrangements can then be made to enable such students to complete their assessment(s). However if after the day of the assessment the school must be notified no more than three working days after the missed assessment(s). The school will decide if this information is acceptable to request a first attempt in August.
"
Ad hoc assessment procedure,"Ad hoc assessments are formal University assessments, managed by the Assessment & Progress Team, that occur outside main assessment periods. Specific procedures relate to these assessments.
Costs?
The University charges schools for ad hoc assessments unless the school can provide reasonable justification to hold them outside the main assessment periods. Reasonable justification, for example, could be General Medical Council requirements.
Request an ad hoc assessment

The University asks schools to provide a schedule of up-coming ad hoc assessments at the start of each academic session. ?
If you need to schedule an ad hoc assessment, complete the Application to request invigilators form?(Word document) as soon as you know details of the assessment, and give a minimum of 15 working days' notice.?
All ad hoc assessments should be conducted within normal office hours, i.e. assessments should start at 9:30am onwards and finish no later than 4:00pm.
If any students taking the assessment require Assessment Access Arrangements, please also complete an Application to request invigilators - Special Circumstances Venues form?(Word document).
Invigilators
The Assessment & Progress Team will notify schools of their allocated invigilators for ad hoc assessments by email.?
Special circumstances
Amanuenses, readers and prompters
Some invigilators are trained as amanuenses, readers or prompters. Indicate on the request form if a student requires any of these services.
Students using these services are allowed 15 minutes extra time per hour. This is not in addition to any extra time the student already receives. Amanuenses are allowed a 15-minute break during the assessment, which is not included in the overall duration.
If a student needs a specialist mentor, the school should arrange this with Disabled Students' Assessment and Support.
Computer assessments
If a student needs a computer assessment, the school should arrange this in liaison with Disabled Students' Assessment and Support and IT.
Cancel an ad hoc assessment
If you need to cancel an ad hoc assessment, notify the Assessment & Progress?Team immediately, giving at least three working days notice. The school will be charged with any costs incurred from a late cancellation.
Change arrangements
If you change the arrangements of an ad hoc assessment, such as the duration or date, there is no guarantee that the invigilators will still be available, and the school may need to provide cover. The school will be charged with any additional costs.
Assessment question papers
Schools can give assessment?papers to the Assessment & Progress?Team in advance, or take them directly to the venue.
If a school gives papers to the Assessment & Progress?Team in advance, then invigilators will take the papers to the venue, and return them to the Assessment & Progress?Team at the end of the assessment so school staff can collect them. You should provide a contact name and telephone number in case of queries.
If a school wishes to take papers directly to the venue, the papers should arrive?at least 30 minutes in advance of the assessment starting for large venues and 15 minutes in advance for smaller venues.
Ad hoc papers should be printed on the same colour of paper as in main assessment periods. The standard paper colours are:

white, if students are permitted to take the question paper away at the end
pink, if students are not permitted to take the question paper with them after the assessment
blue, if students are required to answer questions on the paper

Seat lists and candidate numbers
If an assessment has four candidates or fewer, schools should provide the?Assessment & Progress?Team?with the students¡¯ names so the Team can take gender into account when it allocates invigilators.
If an assessment has more than four candidates, schools should provide the Assessment & Progress?Team with a seating list.
If schools will use multiple venues, there should be a seating list for each venue. Schools must provide multiple copies so that a complete set of seating lists will be available in each venue, and allocate students from seat number one in each venue.
Contact the Assessment & Progress Team for venue accommodation numbers.

"
Ad hoc assessments: on the day of the assessment,"Invigilators will bring signage to the venue, check student ID, collect completed scripts, and report absences, incidents and suspicious behaviour.
Signage and stationery
The Assessment & Progress Team provides invigilators for assessments with more than two candidates with the following material:

""Quiet"" signs for outside the venue
seat numbers
stationery such as absence forms, additional candidate forms and incident report forms
an ad hoc script book checking form.

Candidate absences
If a candidate is absent, the invigilator will complete an absence form and collect it at the end of the assessment in place of a completed script.
Additional candidates
If seats and assessment question papers are available, candidates who arrive unexpectedly will be permitted to sit the assessment. The invigilator will complete an additional candidate form and collect it with the completed script. If no seats or scripts are available, the invigilator will ask the student to report to their school.
Report an incident
Invigilators will report incidents during assessments to the Assessment & Progress Team, using a green incident report form. The Team will forward the report to the relevant school.
Student ID checks
Invigilators will check student ID cards against the seating list. They will ask students without an ID card to sign next to their name on the seating list and give them a notice reminding them to bring their ID card to all exams. The Assessment & Progress Team will then ask school staff to verify the student's signature.
Suspicious behaviour
If an invigilator notes that a student is acting suspiciously, they will contact the Assessment & Progress Team?immediately and a member of the Team will come to the assessment. An invigilator will also complete a green incident report form. All cases of suspected cheating are handled at University level in the same manner as main assessment periods.
Script book collection
At the end of the assessment, invigilators will collect all script books and count them back in against the seating list while students remain in their seats. No student will be allowed to leave the venue until all script books have been collected and checked.
"
Invigilator recruitment,"If you are interested in becoming an invigilator at the University, find out what's involved and how to apply.?

Coursework submission overview,"Things to take into consideration when setting deadlines and explaining coursework submission requirements to students.?
Presentation and referencing?
Aspects of presentation and referencing should be included in the school's Code of practice on assessment. 
Standard guidance on referencing has been approved and students should be directed to the library website?which explains which system is approved for each school and how each system is used. 
Students should be told explicitly if they are required to use a different format or different referencing system for a particular piece of work.
Coursework submission
Deadlines
Schools should make sure they set deadline times well within office hours and make deadline times clear to students. Wherever possible, avoid setting deadlines on Fridays, the last day of term or on the first day of formal examination periods.?
Electronic submission
Electronic submission is usually via turnitin. The VLE service provides advice for staff on using turnitin within the VLE. Schools may ask students to submit both electronically and in hard copy. If this is the case, they should make it clear to students the arrangements that apply if one copy is submitted before the deadline and one is late, or if one copy is submitted but not the other. This information should be included in the school Code of practice on assessment.
If work is submitted electronically a record is kept automatically of the time of submission.
Statements of academic integrity
Students must complete a statement of academic integrity for all coursework submissions. There is a standard form of words but schools and faculties may incorporate the text into their own coversheets. The exact arrangements in place should be made clear in the school Code of practice on assessment.
Penalties which may be applied
If students submit coursework after the given deadline or if they exceed the given word count, the school should apply the appropriate penalties.
Exceeding word count
The school policy should be clearly stated in the Code of practice on assessment. ?
Late submission
Depending on whether a school uses the 20-90 or 0-100 marking scale there are specific expressions of the late submission penalties:
20-90 mark scale
For every period of 24 hours or part thereof that an assessment is overdue, the student will lose 5 marks (assuming the work is marked out of 90 on the 20-90 scale). If a piece of work is handed in within 24 hours of the deadline, 5 marks is deducted; work submitted between 24 and 48 hours late is deducted 10 marks, and so on. The deduction is applied to this particular assessed component before any conflation with other marks to give the overall module result.
Work submitted more than 14 days late will receive a mark of 20 on the 20-90 scale.
If the deduction applied is larger than the mark the work is given, the work will receive a mark of 20 on the 20-90 scale.
0-100 mark scale
For every period of 24 hours or part thereof that an assessment is overdue, the student will lose 5% of the total marks available for the assessment. This equates to 5 marks on the 0-100 scale. The deduction is applied to this particular assessed component before any conflation with other marks to give the overall module result.
Work submitted more than 14 days late will receive a mark of 0 on the 0-100 scale.
If the deduction applied is larger than the mark the work is given, the work will receive a mark of 0 on the 0-100 scale.?
School-specific information
If there are particular types of coursework, for example weekly homework sheets, schools may specify appropriate penalties, and publish these to students in their Code of practice on assessment.?
 
 "
Proof-reading (taught components),"This policy, intended for the guidance of students and academic staff, relates to the?proof-reading of any text to be submitted as part of academic course work, including dissertations.
The?policy on proof-reading (PDF)?provides definitions of proof-reading in the University of Leeds context, and guidance for students and staff to help avoid contravening the policy. It also explains how inappropriate use of proof-reading could lead to a breach of academic integrity and links to the possible consequences of doing this. The policy relates to course work for any foundation-level qualification, undergraduate, taught?postgraduate, or taught component of a research postgraduate degree."
"Cheating, plagiarism, fraudulent or fabricated coursework, and malpractice in University assessments (taught students)","Cheating and plagiarism, fraud and malpractice are taken very seriously. The procedure described here applies to all taught students and for those with taught elements within their research degrees.
The procedure, managed by the Student Cases team within the Secretariat, includes details of penalties, the role of the committee on applications, the appeals process.?The annexes to the procedure are as follows:
Annex 1: The standard declarations of academic integrity? 
Annex 2: A (non-exhaustive) list of examples of malpractice in University assessments 
Annex 3: A note on the range of penalties for students who have plagiarised in a University assessment or have submitted fraudulent or fabricated coursework
?
"
Coursework extensions,"Schools have their own procedures for considering whether to grant extensions to coursework deadlines.?
Some schools do not grant extensions but may waive penalties for late submission if coursework is submitted late because of exceptional circumstances.
Other schools may grant extensions to submission deadlines when there are extenuating circumstances.
Local arrangements are described in the school's code of practice on assessment.?
 "
Internal examiners,"Every taught, credit-bearing module must have an internal examiner- an identified individual that takes responsibility for the assessment and awarded marks on the module.
Schools usually automatically appoint the module leader to the role of internal examiner. Schools may appoint another individual to act as an internal examiner, so long as they follow the guidance below.
Who can be an internal examiner??
Internal examiners must be appropriately qualified and experienced to take responsibility for awarded marks, and must be a contracted member of academic staff.
Current students, including research students, cannot be internal examiners: the only exception to this is where a member of academic staff is also studying as a research student. Current research students may hold appointments as assessment assistants, where they assist with marking but do not have responsibility for final awarded marks.
All fully appointed members of staff within the standard academic grades are entitled to be examiners for the modules and programmes on which they teach, and therefore do not need to be separately appointed as internal examiners.
However, there may be occasions when it is appropriate for another qualified and experienced individual, such as an academic-related staff member, a foreign language assistant, a collaborative partner or a retired or visiting academic, to act as internal examiner.
In such a case, the module leader would retain overall responsibility and accountability for the module while delegating students¡¯ achievement assessment to another.
Responsibility for student assessment ultimately rests with the Head of School. This responsibility includes ensuring that internal examiners are identified for every module and that everyone engaged in student assessment, including internal and external examiners and assessment assistants, are suitably qualified, correctly appointed, have received adequate training and follow the University's agreed policies and procedures.
Nomination

Schools must nominate an individual to act as an internal examiner for each session and submit the completed internal examiner nomination form to QAT.
The nomination should include a brief statement of the proposed internal examiner's role.
A brief academic CV should accompany the nomination, unless the appointment is a repeat appointment from a previous session.
The nomination should state the period of appointment: either co-terminus with the individual's teaching contract, or for a renewable period of one academic session.
Current students are not permitted to hold an appointment as internal examiner unless they are also a member of University staff.
The relevant Faculty Taught Student Education Committee, or the Pro Dean for Student Education acting on the Committee's behalf, must approve the nominee.

Conditions of Appointment

The module leader, who must be a contracted member of academic staff, remains involved in and accountable for the setting and marking of assessments that carry credit towards the final degree results.
A contracted academic staff member moderates marking.
Nominees receive adequate training and guidance.
Internal examiners should be involved in module and programme review, and should be invited to the relevant Assessment Board?meeting.

Training and Guidance
Schools should provide training and guidance for internal examiners that includes:

appropriate induction in respect of assessment conventions employed in the school and faculty
a copy of the school's current code of practice on assessment
where appropriate, attendance at relevant SDDU and/or school training courses
full information on the courses on which they are teaching: for example, module and programme handbooks, teaching materials, handouts, clear assessment criteria and marking schemes
up-to-date information on relevant administrative procedures: for example, the policy on plagiarism and cheating, late or non-submission of work, attendance at classes
constructive feedback on their performance.

External examiners,"External examiners are an essential part of the University's quality assurance processes. The role of the external examiner is to provide assurance to the University that its assessment system is fair and operated equitably, and to ensure comparability of the University's standards with those in peer institutions.
Handbook?
The external examiner handbook provides information on University policies and procedures related to external examining, external examiner appointments and duties, and how the University considers external examiner reports.
??? ?External Examiner Handbook?(PDF)
Appointments
At least one external examiner must be appointed to each taught programme offered by the University.?External examiners are normally appointed for four years. Schools should submit nominations to the Quality Assurance Team using the external examiner nomination form. This should be accompanied by the nominee¡¯s CV and proof of the nominee's eligibility to work as required by United Kingdom Visas and Immigration (UKVI). Nominations must be approved by the Chair of the relevant Faculty Taught Student Education Committee.
??? ?External Examiner Nomination Form (Word)
Sometimes the duties of an external examiner may need to be amended or the appointment period of an external examiner may need to be extended. If required, schools should submit requests to amend the duties or extend the appointment period of an external examiner to the Quality Assurance Team using the relevant form. The requests must be approved by the Chair of the relevant Faculty Taught Student Education Committee. Please note that approval to extend the appointment of an external examiner for a fifth year will only be given in exceptional circumstances.?
??? ?External Examiner Amendment of Duties Form (Word)?
??? ?External Examiner Extension of Appointment Period Form (Word)?
Reports
Each year external examiners?are required to submit an annual report?within six weeks of the relevant Progression and Awards Board. A template is provided to ensure consistency of the reports. External examiners are asked to submit completed reports in Word format?to the Quality Assurance Team.?The Quality Assurance Team will circulate received reports to the relevant schools.
For examiners appointed to both undergraduate and taught postgraduate programmes, a separate report for each is required (the undergraduate report after the June/July meeting of the Progression and Awards Board and the taught postgraduate report after the October/November meeting of the Progression and Awards Board).?
??? External Examiner Report Form (Word)

Fees and expenses
Schools are responsible for the payment of fees and expenses to external examiners.?External examiners are?paid an annual fee?upon receipt of the annual report (this includes the basic fee, per capita fee and any mentoring fee). Fee rates are in the schedule of payments for external examiners 2021/22.?External examiners can also claim reasonable travel and subsistence expenses. Valid expenses will be reimbursed by the relevant school which will provide the necessary claim forms.?

"
Assessment assistants,"
Assessment assistants work under the supervision of an internal examiner to assist with the assessment of students' work.?The internal examiner remains responsible for the awarded marks. 
How are assessment assistants appointed?
The arrangements for appointing, training and supervising assessment assistants are dealt with at the school level, and are the responsibility of the head of school. ?
A school must always maintain a complete, detailed and up-to-date record of such appointments and training received.
In what situations may assessment assistants be appointed?
It is only appropriate to appoint assessment assistants if:
 

The assessment is conducted against well-defined success criteria: for example, in the case of a multiple choice question (MCQ) paper.


There are specific circumstances appropriate to the discipline and these are listed explicitly within the relevant school or faculty Code of practice on assessment which has been approved by the Faculty Taught Student Education Committee.

 
 
How is the work of assessment assistants supervised??
To ensure the quality of the work of assessment assistants, it is important that:
 

assessment assistants are trained


the marking they undertake is comprehensively monitored and moderated


assessment design remains the responsibility of the module leader (assistants may be involved in the design of assessments but only under close supervision and guidance from the module leader)


the school maintains a complete, detailed and up-to-date record of assessment assistants appointed and the training and guidance provided.

 
  "
Resit assessment papers,"
There are some guidelines to follow for preparing and supplying assessment papers for resit assessments.
?
For the academic year 2021/2022, there is an expectation that most assessment will be online (i.e. digital and electronic submissions).? However, some assessments will necessarily need to take place on campus (e.g. performances, laboratory work, etc.).
These additional instructions should be considered in the context of the general advice about the submission of assessment papers.
August resit assessment?papers
Schools are asked to provide resit papers as soon after the semester 2 assessment period as possible, but no later than the published deadline (see the timeline).
Resit papers will not be made available to students after the assessments.
Special resit papers
Where the syllabus for a module has changed and a student resitting the module requires a paper for the earlier syllabus, a special paper must be provided. It is the school's responsibility to inform the Assessment & Progress Team of this necessity on the assessment schedule.
"
Resit eligibility and registration,"There are special procedures to be followed if a student needs to be re-assessed after failing previous assessments.
?
Eligibility
UNDERGRADUATES
Undergraduate students who have a start date prior to academic term 2016/2017 are permitted three attempts to pass a module; the first attempt plus up to two resits.
Undergraduate students who have a start date in academic term 2016/2017 are permitted two attempts to pass a module; the first attempt plus one resit.
An exception to this rule is International Foundation year students who studied their foundation year in academic year 2015/2016. These students will continue under the old?regulations and will be permitted three attempts to pass a module; the first attempt plus up to two resits.
If you are unsure of the start date of a student, it is?recorded in Banner form SWARDAT.
Below are examples of where the old or new?rule applies:
Old Rule

Foundation year students (both non-international and international) who started their studies in academic term 2015/2016 and who begin studying for a degree starting in September 2016.
Students who repeat a year; e.g. due to mitigating circumstances
Students who transfer to a new programme of study and do not advance a year; e.g. started a BA English year one in September 2015 and transfers to BA French year one in September 2016.

New Rule

Direct entrants who register on year 2, 3, etc. of their programme in 2016/2017 and onwards.

Any undergraduate student who has failed a module will normally be eligible for an August reassessment provided that he or she made a serious attempt at the original assessment in January or May/June; and the format of the original assessment is suitable to be re-assessed in August.
In the following cases, under the old rule,?a third and final attempt will normally be permitted in the following academic session when the module is next offered (in either January or May/June):

failure in an August reassessment
if the candidate has been debarred from the August reassessment (i.e. a second attempt has been disallowed)
if the candidate does not apply to sit in August (i.e. the second attempt has been forfeited by the candidate)
if the exam has been missed in August without good cause.?

POSTGRADUATES
Postgraduate students are permitted one resit attempt, which must be taken at the next opportunity.? This will be in the?resit?examination/assessment period for their cohort?if a resit opportunity?is offered for that module, otherwise the next attempt will take place in the following academic session.? Schools must advise students when the resit opportunity will be for each of their modules.
Registering for resit assessments and assessed work
Students who have resit opportunities remaining for failed modules will be able to apply for resits on the Results and Resit Application screen on the Student Services website available through Minerva?when their final?results are published.?
Postgraduate students whose results are still provisional when they need to apply for?resits will be able to complete an online Resit Application Form available from the Provisional Marks page on?Minerva.
A deadline for resit applications applies, after which the online application facility will be removed (see the timeline?for dates).
It is essential that students register by the published deadline for all assessments and assessed work that they intend to complete. A late fee will apply to applications received after the deadline, and the assessment timetable will only reflect those modules for which applications have been made. Eligible students should be preparing for?re-assessment once their results are known.
Personal assessment timetables are available online to all students who have applied and indicate the modules for re-assessment and the date, time, location of the assessment and the student's allocated seat number. Students can also refer to the published timetables displayed online.
There are two Banner reports which schools can run to find out which students have applied to resit:? SWROLRA for August/September resits; SWROLRC for external and carried module resits.
More information on applying for?resits and applying to resit carried modules is available to students.
Re-assessment Period?2022
For the academic year 2021/2022, there is an expectation that most re-assessment will be online (i.e. digital and electronic submissions). However, some assessments will necessarily need to take place on campus (e.g.?performances, laboratory work, etc.).? The re-assessment periods will depend upon the student¡¯s cohort.
For students who are resitting carried modules in 2021/2022, the re-assessment is expected to take place at the next available assessment period, either January or May/June.? (E.g. for Semester 1 modules, this will be in the January assessment period).
Cohort One ¨C?Undergraduate students starting in September 2021
The August Re-Assessment period will be scheduled from Tuesday 16?August 2022?to Friday 26?August 2022?including Saturday 20?August 2022.
Cohort Two ¨C?Taught Postgraduate students starting in September 2021
The August Re-Assessment period will be scheduled from Tuesday 16?August 2022?to Friday 26?August 2022?including Saturday 20?August 2022.
Cohort Three ¨C?Leeds University Business School (LUBS) Taught Postgraduate students starting in September 2020
The September Re-Assessment period was scheduled from Monday 6?September 2021 to Friday 17?September 2021 including Saturday 11?September 2021.
Cohort Four ¨C?Taught Postgraduate?students starting on 25?January 2021
The re-assessments will take place during the May/June 2022 Assessment period from Monday 16 May 2022 to Wednesday 1 June 2022 including Saturday 21 and 28 May 2022.
Cohort Five ¨C?Taught Postgraduate students starting on?18?January 2021
The re-assessments will take place during the January 2022 Assessment period from Monday 10 January 2022 to Friday 21 January 2022 including Saturday 15 January 2022.
Cohort Six ¨C?Civil Engineering Taught Postgraduate students starting on 18?January 2021
The re-assessments will take place during the January 2022 Assessment period from Monday 10 January 2022 to Friday 21 January 2022 including Saturday 15 January 2022.
The times for the assessment sessions during the re-assessment periods may change depending on the type of assessment?but are usually:

9.00am to 12.00 noon
2.00pm to 5.00pm.?

Students sitting modules as ""first attempts""
All ""first attempts"" must be authorised as such by the relevant Board?within the student's parent school.
The students should be notified in writing or face to face, and it should be made clear that accepting the first attempt will result in the original mark being expunged, even if the first attempt mark is lower. Once the student is clear on this, they should confirm in writing of their intention to accept the first attempt. It's recommended that a standard letter stating all modules affected be produced which the student should sign.
Once confirmation is received from the student, the school should update the progression tool (SWAPRGT) to flag which first attempts the student has accepted and when?each first attempt will take place (flag with an A for an August/September first attempt, or C for a carried module first attempt to be taken in the next academic session).
The schools then produce the SWRPRFA report and forward this on to the Assessment & Progress?Team. The report shows all the students the school has flagged in the progression tool. The Assessment & Progress?Team will update SWARSIT/SFAREGS as necessary?to show that all those on the SWRPRFA report have applied for a first attempt. This means that there will be no need for the students to apply online. (This part of the process should pend until the marks are in academic history, so if a school updates the tool in February but the results are not sent through until June Banner will not be updated immediately).
For more information on how to use the Progression Tool, please refer to the B270PT Progression Tool Banner training manual?and the First Attempts Process.
Resit fees
Resit fees are charged as follows:

¡ê2 per credit (i.e. ¡ê20 for a 10 credit module) PLUS
¡ê50 administration fee (increased to ¡ê100 after the stated deadline).?

When the?Assessment & Progress?Team have applied the charges to students¡¯ University accounts, students will receive a statement of fees by email and must pay immediately.? Failure to pay will result in late payment administration charges of ¡ê20 per month until the debt is repaid in full.
Charges for August resit fees will be charged?after 1 August.? External and carried module resit fees will be charged after the deadline for resit applications has passed.??
If the student has been granted ""first attempt"" reassessments, resit fees won't be charged.
Assessed work deadlines
Students should contact the teaching school directly to find out the deadlines for submitting assessed work.


Cancelling a resit application
Students should email the Assessment & Progress?Team?to cancel a resit application.
Cancellations may only be made up until the start of the assessment period during which the resit will be taking place.? After this their application will stand and any resit fees will still be charged.? Students will lose an attempt if they do not take the resit.
Resitting internally
Only in exceptional circumstances will a student be allowed to resit internally:

The student has missed too much teaching to make any progress without further teaching.
The student has failed a laboratory module (element) and needs to use the laboratory facilities to be able to pass.
The student had mitigating circumstances and has been permitted to expunge the results of the year/semester and retake the whole year/semester internally as first attempts.

Replacement modules
Subject to the requirements of the programme of study, undergraduate candidates are permitted to replace a module only if:

the module is a discovery?or optional module
the candidate has failed the first attempt at the module and not attempted a resit
the module is not a replacement module itself.?

Any candidate wishing to replace a module should discuss this with their parent school before the re-assessment?period. After this time, they will be marked absent for the second attempt and will be unable to replace the module the following session. Students will take the assessment for the replacement module at the end of either Semester 1 or Semester 2 when the?assessment is next offered. However, students will only be able to achieve a mark of 40 in the replacement module. Students may only achieve more than 40 if they have received prior approval from the relevant Faculty Special Cases Committee.
Students will be allowed two attempts to pass the replacement module under the old?rule and one under the new rule.
The replaced module will be made RD on Banner and will remain on the student's transcript. The replacement module will be recorded on Banner as RM.
"
Marking,"Assessments?are marked anonymously. Processes are in place to ensure the fairness and equity of marks awarded.
Anonymous marking
Anonymous marking must be adopted for all assessments with the following exceptions:

Where the assessment takes the form of a practical demonstration performed in the presence of examiners eg oral assessments, clinical practice, performance.
Where assessment takes place over a period of time with support from a designated supervisor or tutor eg projects, dissertations, portfolios.
Where the assessment takes place during a module for formative purposes and anonymity might prevent speedy and effective feedback e.g. examples classes.

Any further exceptions must be approved by the relevant Faculty Taught Student Education Committee, reported to Taught Student Education Board and published for students by the school concerned. Where anonymous marking is not appropriate, schools must ensure that internal moderation is rigorous to ensure that marking is accurate and consistent.
Check marking?
All schools must have arrangements in place, and documented, for checking the marks awarded to assessed work, either through double-marking on systematic monitoring.?
Role of external examiner in the marking process
The external examiner ratifies module marks. They normally look at a sample of assessed work to satisfy themselves that the marks awarded are fair and equitable. If they are not fully confident in the marks awarded, they may ask for:

additional samples of all the student work within the group
additional samples of an element of the assessed work of all the students within the group
moderation of the marks of all the students within the group.?


Exceptionally, they may determine a mark:

if they have been specifically invited to adjudicate between internal markers
in specialist discipline areas (such as Bulgarian or Mongolian) where only one internal examiner has the appropriate expertise.?



Re-marking of scripts
The Committee on Applications decide whether a script should be re-marked. If a candidate wishes to appeal against a mark for a module, they may do so by following the appeals procedure. A script cannot be re-marked unless the student has formally appealed and the Committee on Applications has upheld the appeal.

Archiving of scripts
Scripts should be archived for a minimum of one year after the student has completed their studies or withdrawn from the University. Schools are, however, encouraged to store scripts for longer if space is available as academic references are often sought for former students.
Legibility and clarity
It is the student¡¯s responsibility to write clearly and legibly during written assessments. Examiners may refuse to mark a script or require the student to read or re-write the script, either of which will result in the student forfeiting their right to anonymous marking.

Marking scales and non-numeric marks,"From academic year 2018/19 all University assessments will be marked on a 0-100 scale (or a categorical marking scale aligned to a 0-100 scale).
From 2018/19 the 20-90 marking scale will no longer be used by the University and all modules will be marked on the 0-100 marking scale.??
Pre-2018/19 marks which were graded on the 20-90 scale will be translated to the 0-100 scale for classification purposes.? A translation table is available on the?Marking Scale?page.?
Faculties and schools (other than the Schools of Medicine and Dentistry in relation to the MBChB and MChD/BChD programmes) must mark undergraduate and postgraduate modules, assessment scripts and other assessed work using the 0-100 scale.
The full range of marks from 0-100 is available.?
All assessed work is marked according to the achievement represented.?
Marks used?
The following table includes all non-numeric grades/marks approved for use within all the University's grading schemes. The marks with an asterisk (*) are not for use in taught postgraduate modules. Fuller descriptions of the situations in which these marks are used is given below the table.

Description of marks
?
Grades/marks including a decimal point are not permitted. Where a non-numeric code constitutes a part of a grade/mark, this must be recorded in upper case. Further information is given in the Rules for Award.
The use of 39N and 49N has been discontinued from the 2014/15 session.
40 - 100* (pass marks - undergraduate modules only)
Where a candidate has completed the requirements of a level 1, 2, 3 or 4 module and achieves a mark of 40 or more in that module they are deemed to have passed that module and will be awarded the credit for it. No further attempt is permitted.
0 - 39* (fail marks with resit opportunity - undergraduate modules only)
Where a candidate has completed the requirements of a level 1, 2, 3 or 4 module and achieves a mark of 39 or less in that module, they are deemed to have failed that module and will not awarded the credit for it.
A candidate will be permitted a (single) resit in the module at a time permitted under the rules for progression (or two resit attempts if pre-2016/17 rules apply). The maximum mark that can be awarded for a resit is 40.
Assessment Boards can in some circumstances allow a student to retake an assessment as a ""first attempt"". In this situation, the full range of marks is available.
50 - 100 (pass marks - postgraduate modules only)
Where a candidate achieves a mark of 50 or more in an M level module, they are deemed to have passed that module and will be awarded the 'M' level credits for it. No further attempt is permitted.
0 - 49 (fail marks with resit opportunity - postgraduate modules only)
Where a candidate has completed all the requirements of an M level module and achieves a mark of 49 or less in that module, they are deemed to have failed that module and will not be awarded the credit for it.
A candidate will be permitted a (single) resit in the module at a time permitted under the rules for progression. The maximum mark that can be awarded for a resit is 50.
Assessment Boards can in some circumstances allow a student to retake an assessment as a ""first attempt"". In this situation, the full range of marks is available.?
AB (absent from assessment/failed to produce coursework)
Signifies that the student was absent from the whole assessment and failed to submit any assessed work required for a module irrespective of whether this is deliberate or not. If unredeemed on a further assessment allowed as a first attempt or on re-assessment this translates to a module grade of 0.0 for classification purposes. (Examiners should use the ""V"" and ""C"" codes below to indicate where only part of the assessment?has been completed.)
S*- for undergraduate modules only:
i) to indicate that the Assessment Board has determined that the student should be denied a resit?on the grounds of exceptionally poor performance at the first attempt. It is used only in exceptional circumstances;
ii) to indicate the format of the resit is unsuitable to be assessed in August.
The suffix S is not shown on a student transcript; the numeric mark achieved at the first attempt will be shown.
V (compulsory module component(s) incomplete - credits denied)
A grade with the suffix V signifies mandatory criteria (such as submission of mandatory components or meeting minimum accreditation requirements) have not been met. The V suffix is used to show that the module is not passed and credit is not awarded (if a pass mark). If the V remains unredeemed on classification; the maximum classification grade of 3.9 for undergraduate modules and 4.9 for taught postgraduate modules should be used. The transcript will show 'INC' to signify that the work is incomplete.
For a student to redeem a V, a deadline for the submission of outstanding work must be set by the faculty/school; on submission of the outstanding work to a satisfactory standard, the suffix is removed and credit awarded. The final module grade is unchanged, except for the removal of the V. Once the V is removed, the normal rules on the classification grade apply and the mark appears on the transcript.
C (module component(s) incomplete owing to Special Circumstances1 )
A grade with the suffix C signifies that one or more elements of assessable work remain to be presented or completed, owing to special circumstances. The original grade should reflect only the proportion of assessable work that has actually been done. Where no work has been completed (a deferred mark) 0C should be returned.?
For a student to redeem a C, a deadline for the submission of outstanding work must be set by the faculty/school; on submission of the outstanding work, the grade is recalculated to include the marks awarded for the submitted work and the suffix is removed. If unredeemed, the mark stands unless some mandatory criteria has not been met. Then the V mark replaces the C.
D (deferred assessment through teaching arrangements)
The D suffix is not used to signify a grade or mark but to identify the position in which the grades/marks for all students following a particular module is deferred due to a specific teaching pattern. The use of this suffix awards credit.
G (plagiarism penalty - credits awarded)
This can be used with any mark from 0 to 99 to indicate a plagiarism penalty. It will award credit where the mark is less than the pass mark.
H (plagiarism penalty - credits withheld)
This can be used with any mark from 0 to 99 to indicate a plagiarism penalty. It will withhold credit where the mark is more than the pass mark and would normally receive credit.
I (incomplete pending investigation of plagiarism)
Indicates that a mark is not available due to an ongoing investigation into possible plagiarism. ?The ""I"" is a temporary mark and should be amended as follows once an outcome has been reached:
?

If the student is found not guilty of plagiarism, the ""I"" mark should be replaced with the actual mark that the student achieved.
If the student is found guilty of plagiarism, the ""I"" mark should be replaced with the penalty mark ""0H"".?

P (pass)
Denotes a pass in a?module which is being marked on a pass/fail basis.
F (fail)
Denotes a fail in a module which is being marked on a pass/fail basis.
Z (no mark required2)
Indicates that a student has either temporarily or permanently withdrawn from the University or should not have appeared on a particular mark list, for example through administrative error or through having received APEL for the module concerned.
Students who have already withdrawn will show on the mark list as WD.
Combinations

ABS - Signifies that the student was absent from/failed to submit?the assessment?and is debarred from re-sitting the module in the re-assessment period and forfeits the second attempt.
ABV - Signifies that the student was absent from/failed to submit the assessment and that one or more elements of assessable work remain to be presented and that it/these must be passed before credit can be awarded
ABC - Signifies that the student was absent from/failed to submit the assessment and that one or more elements of assessable work remain to be presented owing to Special Circumstances 1.
PC - Denotes a pass in module which is being marked on a pass/fail basis and one or more elements of assessable work remain to be presented owing to Special Circumstances 1.
PV - Denotes a pass in a module which is being marked on a pass/fail basis and one or more elements of assessable work remain to be presented and that it/these must be passed before credit can be awarded.
FC - Denotes a fail in a module which is being marked on a pass/fail basis and one or more elements of assessable work remain to be presented owing to Special Circumstances 1.
FV - Denotes a fail in a module which is being marked on a pass/fail basis and one or more elements of assessable work remain to be presented and that it/these must be passed before credit can be awarded.

* marks not for use in postgraduate modules.
1 'Special circumstances' can be defined as any situation which would normally involve further action e.g. consideration of mitigating circumstances at departmental exam boards or a case submitted to the FSCC.
2 Z should be entered via Banner with an annotation on the hard copy of the mark sheet to inform the Assessment & Progress Team of the reason why the student should not have appeared on the marksheet or, if the student has withdrawn, whether the withdrawal is permanent or temporary.
"
Provisional marks,"Provisional marks should be entered in to Banner and students alerted so that they can see them.
?
How to publish provisional?marks
You need to let students know when their provisional marks for their module(s) are available to view in the Student Services area of Minerva.
To enter the provisional marks in Banner:

enter them in the grade column in SWADMRK and click the ""Display as provisional"" button, or;
tick the check box in SWADMKU.

If you click the ""Display as provisional marks"" button by mistake
Delete the marks from the grade column in SWADMRK then click on the ""Display as provisional marks"" button. This will display the marks as blank on the webpage.
If you need help using Banner, see training document B220 Departmental Exams.
Modules taught over more than one semester
It is at the discretion of each individual school whether or not to give mid-term marks. If you do, follow the procedure above.
Provisional semester two marks
Undergraduates
Do not provide provisional semester two marks. Enter the final marks into Banner by following the steps below. The marks will be published on the official publication date.

Enter the marks into SWADMRK but do not click on the ""display as provisional marks"" button
upload the marks using SWADMKU but do not tick the check box.

Once the marks have been finalised and entered/uploaded into SWADMRK, click the ""release"" button. This releases the marks as final to Student Administration and will not display the marks on the provisional marks webpage on Student Services.
Final marks will be displayed on the results and resits application section.
Postgraduates
You may choose to display provisional?module marks for students who will not be able to view their final marks until later in the academic session.
How students view their provisional marks
Students access the provisional marks section of Student Services by logging into Minerva.
This section is available to students all year round. However, once the final marks are returned to Student Administration and rolled into academic history, the provisional marks will be removed from the ""prov. display"" column in SWADMRK and the provisional marks webpage.
Final marks will be displayed on the results and resit application section.
"
Final results,"Marks and classifications must be uploaded into Banner and released to the Assessment & Progress?Team and the necessary paperwork submitted by the deadline.
The deadlines for return of marks and classifications can be found in the Timeline of Events.
RETURN OF FINAL MARKS
Once marks have been agreed by the Assessment Board they can be entered into the Banner form SWADMRK (or SWADRMK for resits). Following ratification by both the internal and external examiners they can be released to the Assessment & Progress Team for processing by clicking the 'Release marks' button.??
Schools are required to send to the?Assessment & Progress Team?the Notification of Approved Module Marks memo with a full and accurate list of the modules where marks have been approved by the internal and external examiners, and released. The list should include confirmation that the marks have been approved by the internal and external examiners, the full module code and title, the module CRN, and the academic year.? ?The memo can be found on the Process Management SharePoint?site.? (To?to access the site members of staff will need to use?their University username and password.? If?unsure of how to access the site staff members should contact their Functional Manager.)
The Assessment & Progress Team will only roll marks into academic history once the memo has been received and the marks will not appear on Minerva for students to view until they have been rolled into academic history.
Schools will be unable to make any further changes to marks once they have been released.? Any requests for amendments to marks should be submitted to?the?Student Cases Team via the?completed online form and sent together with the signature or approval of both the internal and external examiners.? Once approved?the mark will be changed in Banner.? More information on the process can be found on?the Process Management SharePoint?site.
For more information on how to input marks into Banner, please refer to the B220 Departmental Exams Banner training manual.
RETURN OF CLASSIFICATIONS
Classifications can be released to the Assessment & Progress Team through the Classification Tool on Banner (SWADCLT). The tool will only allow a classification to be released if all the student's marks have been released by the teaching schools and the Notification of Approved Awards and Classification memo with a full and accurate list of the programmes which have been approved by the internal and external examiners is received by the Assessment & Progress Team.
Change of Awards cannot be released from the Classification Tool, the Assessment & Progress Team must enter these awards manually.? Details of what the changed award is (both the new programme and classification)?should be noted in the comments section in the Classication Tool.
The memo should include confirmation that the awards and/or classifications have been approved by the internal and external examiners, the full programme code and title and the academic year.? ?The memo can be found on the Process Management?SharePoint?site.
The memo must be submitted to the?Assessment & Progress Team.?
For more information on using the Classification Tool, please refer to the B273T Classification Tool training manual.
RELEASING RESULTS IN SCHOOLS TO STUDENTS
Schools may release provisional marks and grades to students when these are available, however final results may not be released to students until after the official results day.
After this time, Schools may post final results within the school (using anonymous mark sheets/pass lists) and offer feedback on performance and information on resits and/or progression to students.?
RELEASE OF RESULTS BY THE ASSESSMENT & PROGRESS?TEAM
On the official results day, all marks and classifications which have been rolled into academic history will be released to students on the Results and Resit Application page (available via Minerva).
"
Progression,"Students can only progress to the next year of their programme of studies or progress to receive their award once they have met certain criteria.?
The minimum attendance, study and credit requirements for awards are prescribed in the Curricular Ordinances and Regulations.??
For students to be able to progress to the next programme year or to the award of a degree, diploma or certificate, they need to have:
?

complied with the requirements of the relevant Curricular Ordinance and Regulations (including obtaining sufficient credits at the appropriate level in the prescribed manner); and
met the learning outcomes for the relevant programme year or award as detailed in the programme specification. This includes:
	
passing all modules indicated as ""pass for progression/award? for the relevant year/award in the programme specification; and
meeting any other requirements set out in the programme specification.



However, due to the current situation, for students who were unable to resit failed assessments in August in the academic session 2019/20, where necessary, they have been permitted to progress?without having achieved the minimum amount of credits or without having completed pass for progression modules, in the expectation that those students will complete the required credits/pass for progression modules in 2020/21.?
To be eligible for award, students must also have achieved a classification average?which is equal to or greater than the prescribed minimum.
Progression and award boards?
Progression and awards boards take full responsibility on behalf of the Senate for the classification of awards to students for whom they are responsible. They work within the?agreed framework of the responsibilities of examinations boards and progression and award boards and their terms of reference. They judge all students within the?approved procedures, documenting their deliberations and the outcomes agreed and?considering all students fairly, consistently and transparently.
Progression and awards boards are required to implement progression or award decisions in accordance with the programme specification.

Progression exercises
Progression is undertaken by Parent Schools for all continuing taught undergraduate students. For returning taught postgraduate students, progression is not necessary. Progression takes place in June after the May/June exams and again in September to allow for updates to be made to students whose progression status has changed following the August resits.
The progression exercise is the process which controls and manages a returning undergraduate student's ability to register online. The eligible to register status (EL) on SWAREGS will be the mechanism to allow students to register online.
The Progression Tool (SWAPRGT) enables you?to complete the progression exercise.
Guidance on how to use the Progression Tool can be found in the training manual?(B270PT).

For staff who have not undertaken the Progression Tool Computer Based training, email the SIMS training team.

"
First attempts process,"This page provides you with information on what a first attempt is.??
You can also find guidance on the first attempts process,?information relating to students wanting to take their first attempts overseas and answers to other frequently asked questions relating to this process.
What is a first attempt?
Some students suffer circumstances beyond their control during the teaching and assessment of modules.? Such students are advised to submit a mitigating circumstances case. The School Special Cases Committee (SSCC) may consider the case and agree that the circumstances were outside the student¡¯s control and therefore grant a further opportunity to achieve a true mark (not capped at a pass mark as a resit is) this is known as a first attempt.
When a first attempt is granted and the student accepts it, the original mark is expunged from the student¡¯s record and the student is permitted to retake the examination in the relevant re-assessment period and receive the full mark.? (A1 on Banner or C1 if permitted as a carried module for the following session).
The schools update information on the Progression Tool to indicate a first attempt has been approved and accepted, run the Module First Attempts Report (SWRPRFA) and email this to the Assessment & Progress Team, who update the student¡¯s record in Banner accordingly.
The student may find that circumstances change and they need to retain the original mark and lose the first attempt.? The school must receive notification of this in writing before the day of the exam or before the student physically takes the examination.? If the student sits the examination or the date of examination passes and no notification has been received, the student is not permitted to retain the original mark.
The schools update information on the Progression Tool for both UG and TP students to indicate a first attempt has been approved and accepted, run the SWRPRFA report and email this to the Assessment & Progress Team, who update the student¡¯s record in Banner accordingly.
What is the First Attempts process?
Schools hold the SSCC (Schools Special Cases Committee) and the decisions are made.? These should be taken to the Progression & Award Boards?for approval.?
The students are notified in writing or face to face, (it should be made clear that accepting the first attempt will result in the original mark being expunged, even if the first attempt mark is lower).?
The student should confirm in writing their intention to accept the first attempt and that they understand the mark(s) will be expunged and cannot be reinstated.? It was suggested that a standard letter stating all modules affected be produced and the student be required to sign this.? This should be kept within the school.
Once this confirmation is received from the student, the school should update the Progression Tool to show all students that have been given and accepted first attempts. (Further information can be found on?Resit Eligibility and Registration).? The schools run the Module First Attempts Report (SWRPRFA) from the Progression Tool and email it to the?Assessment & Progress Team.? (Board minutes are no longer required).
The report will show all the students with a first attempt, per module, which the school have flagged in the Progression Tool.
The Assessment & Progress Team will use the SWRPRFA report to update the Resit Status Maintenance Form (SWARSIT) in Banner for the re-assessment period (or SFAREGS if the student is resitting as a carried module in the following session).? This means that there will be no need for the students to apply online, but if they do, the Assessment & Progress Team will carry out checks and process the application.
Schools need to adhere to the deadlines for submitting first attempt information to enable the Assessment & Progress Team to produce assessment timetables based on accurate data.? Please refer to?the Programmes and Assessment Timeline for key date information.?
For undergraduate students, flowcharts of the process for non finalist students, finalist students in July and finalist students in September are available to view in PDF format.
Questions often asked in relation to First Attempts:
What do the codes on Banner mean?
In Banner a number of status¡¯ are used to indicate what attempt a student is taking.? Before the students apply to retake their assessments, all module status¡¯ are updated to indicate the student is eligible to a further attempt at that module.?

RT ¨C eligible to a further attempt at the module in the re-assessment period.
	?? This status is recorded on SWARSIT ¨C Resit Status Maintenance Form.
CN ¨C eligible to a further attempt at the module as a Carried Module, the following session.
	?? This status is recorded on SWAREGS ¨C Student Course Registration Form.

Once an application has been received from the student or via a SWRPRFA report from the school, the Banner records are updated accordingly to show the following:
On SWARSIT:

A1 ¨C First attempt permitted and accepted, to be taken in the re-assessment?period.
A2 ¨C Second attempt applied for, to be taken in the re-assessment period.
A3 ¨C Third and final attempt applied for, to be taken in the re-assessment period.

On SWAREGS:

C1 ¨C First attempt permitted and accepted*.
C2 ¨C Second attempt applied for*.
C3 ¨C Third and final attempt applied for*.
T1 ¨C Student permitted to re attend teaching for a first attempt and accepted*.
T2 ¨C Student applied to re attend teaching for a second attempt*.
T3 ¨C Student applied to re attend teaching for a third and final attempt*.

* The assessment will be taken in the relevant assessment period, when the module is next offered, in the session following the original attempt.
How many attempts are Taught students permitted:
This depends on whether the student is undergraduate or postgraduate; and if undergraduate, whether they started the programme of study before 2016/2017 or after; please refer to?Resit Eligibility and Registration for detailed guidance.
How do students access?Minerva (Portal and VLE) and apply?to resit?
If eligible, the student should log into?Minerva (Portal and VLE) using their University username and password, for more information on how to apply and access Minerva, please refer to?Resits.
How do students access?Minerva (Portal and VLE) and apply?to take approved first attempts?overseas?
Due to the current situation, there is an expectation that the majority of assessments in 2020/21 will be online.? However, if any resits are planned as written on-campus assessments, then any students wishing to take the assessment in their home country will need to apply to sit it overseas.
For any written on-campus assessments, students?may be eligible to take the?resit (or approved further first attempt) assessments abroad if:

Their home address is outside the UK and they are asking to sit the exam in their home country.
They are working or studying abroad as part of their programme.
They are an exchange student who has already returned home.

The assessment must be suitable to be taken outside the University and a suitable assessment?environment must be available (e.g. British Council; home university).
A flowchart of the process including students applying to sit overseas is available to view in PDF format.
When a student has logged into Minerva and accessed their results information, they will receive information relating to taking assessments abroad.? It is the student¡¯s responsibility to access the link to indicate their intention to take the assessments overseas.? They must enter the city and the country of their preferred British Council (e.g. Sao Paulo, Brazil) and then submit.
The Assessment & Progress Team will check that the preferred British Council is able to accommodate assessments, and will email the student if there are any problems.
If there isn't a British Council near to where the student lives, but they have found a suitable alternative institution which has agreed to accommodate their assessments, the student should email Overseas Assessments before the deadline with their request, their full name, their?student identification?number and the name and contact details for the institution.
If they haven't already done so, students should apply for the modules they want to resit or liaise with their Parent School regarding approved first attempts.
What?are the deadlines for notifying the Assessment & Progress Team of first attempts?
Different deadlines?are set to receive information from schools depending on whether the information relates to a finalist student or a non-finalist, please refer to the Programmes and Assessment Timeline of Events for the relevant deadlines.
The deadline for the receipt of information on finalists?applying to re-sit*, in an attempt to improve their award,?is driven by the need for decisions on ceremony attendance at the Degree Ceremonies.??
The deadline for receipt of information regarding non-finalist students is driven by the need to produce the relevant re-assessment timetable.? It is crucial schools meet the deadline for the completion of the progression exercise and deadline for non-finalists to apply to re-sit, to enable the accurate capture of data for the population of the assessment timetable.
*Where a student has passed a module but has been granted and accepted a first attempt, the online process cannot identify and flag these modules, so the students cannot apply on line. The Assessment & Progress Team relies on schools for this information.

Modules taught over more than one semester
It is at the discretion of each individual school whether or not to give mid-term marks. If you do, follow the procedure above.
Provisional semester two marks
Undergraduates
Do not provide provisional semester two marks. Enter the final marks into Banner by following the steps below. The marks will be published on the official publication date.

Enter the marks into SWADMRK but do not click on the ""display as provisional marks"" button
upload the marks using SWADMKU but do not tick the check box.

Once the marks have been finalised and entered/uploaded into SWADMRK, click the ""release"" button. This releases the marks as final to Student Administration and will not display the marks on the provisional marks webpage on Student Services.
Final marks will be displayed on the results and resits application section.
Postgraduates
You may choose to display provisional?module marks for students who will not be able to view their final marks until later in the academic session.
How students view their provisional marks
Students access the provisional marks section of Student Services by logging into Minerva.
This section is available to students all year round. However, once the final marks are returned to Student Administration and rolled into academic history, the provisional marks will be removed from the ""prov. display"" column in SWADMRK and the provisional marks webpage.
Final marks will be displayed on the results and resit application section.
"
Temporary disability,"Temporary disability or illness can have an impact on how students are able to access learning, and they may need extra support or advice when taking assessments. Find out about mitigating circumstances and who to contact.
Students with a temporary incapacity
If students are unwell or are experiencing a short-term disability during an assessment period and require modified arrangements, the school needs to be notified as soon as possible. If they can't complete their University assessments for?temporary health or access reasons, staff must advise the relevant school and the Assessment & Progress Team immediately (except in the case of absence from an assessment or illness during an assessment). A?designated room will be available for approved candidates to sit assessments.
Approval is reached through a departmental recommendation to the University Assessment & Progress Officer. The Assessment & Progress Team will advise approved candidates of the arrangements and procedures prior to the assessment period.
Where a student¡¯s incapacity is of a temporary nature, the personal tutor or departmental examinations/assessments officer should obtain supporting evidence of the condition and its impact on assessment. If modifications to the standard assessment process are necessary, the personal tutor or departmental examinations/assessments?officer should make recommendations to the Assessment & Progress Team, in consultation with the individual student and the external examiners. ?
What do students need to do?
Once students have notified us of a disability, they can review their special assessment arrangements via?Minerva?(log into Student Services, click on the ¡°Examinations¡± tab, then select ¡°Examination arrangements¡±).
Mitigating circumstances
Students should be advised to check their school's individual mitigating circumstances policy, including deadlines for each semester and where to submit the claim.?
If they are absent from an assessment or believe that their performance in an assessment has been affected by illness or other adverse circumstances, a written explanation must be provided to their parent/teaching school(s) within five working days of the assessment. In the case of illness, this must be accompanied by a full medical certificate from a doctor.
Students must submit written evidence in advance of the meeting where their results are to be considered. It's their responsibility to find out the date of this meeting - and can consult the school/departmental office. Evidence supplied after the meeting can't be taken into consideration.
Individual schools will deal with any claims, so students should seek guidance from them about what constitutes mitigating circumstances and how to complete a request.
Find out more about mitigating circumstances.?
?
"
Mitigating circumstances,"Mitigating circumstances are normally exceptional, short term, unforeseen and unpreventable events that have a significantly disruptive effect on the student¡¯s ability to take assessments.? These events are over and above the course of everyday life and normally outside of their control.? The events may affect the student¡¯s ability to complete coursework or other assessments and revise for and attend on-campus assessments.??
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF???
Mitigating Circumstances?is the umbrella term used by the University of Leeds for the process by which students can seek mitigation for the impact on their ability to complete assessments.?
Students may allude to circumstances that have affected their studies?via their?Academic?Personal Tutor or School Student Support Officer, but this is not sufficient to enable these circumstances to be taken into consideration. There is a formal procedure to follow, a deadline to meet and evidence required to support such claims. If one of your students does mention adverse circumstances that appear to have affected their studies, then this should act as a trigger for you to discuss the formal?Mitigating?Circumstances?process with the student.?
As the onus is on the student to make and evidence the claim for mitigation, then part of your role as an?Academic Personal Tutor?or as a member of the?Student Education Service may be to encourage the student to follow the formal process to ensure that any such circumstances are considered by their Parent?school's?Special Circumstances Committee.??However, it would not be your role to pre-empt or pre-judge the outcomes of such a?Committee, but to advise the student regarding the process.?
There are two routes of mitigation available: ¡®Extensions to Coursework Deadlines¡¯?and ¡®Additional Consideration¡¯.?
Please see the?Mitigating Circumstances Guidance 2021-2022?(Word) for full details, including how?students?apply for an?Extension to a Coursework Deadline?or?Additional Consideration.?
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES OR LONG-TERM HEALTH CONDITIONS?
Disabled?students, or?students with?a long-term health condition (12 months or more) that impacts on?their?day-to-day activities, should register with Disability Services who will advise further on support and reasonable adjustments to?their?study and assessment.? Disability includes Specific Learning Difficulties (such as dyslexia and dyspraxia), as well as diagnosed mental health conditions.?
IF THE STUDENT DOES NOT SIT THEIR ASSESSMENTS AND DOES NOT MAKE AN APPLICATION FOR MITIGATION?
The students are expected to contact their schools to let them know what is happening.??If they do not submit an assessment and do not apply for mitigation they may be withdrawn from their studies.?
If the student is unable to contact their school at any stage, it is important that they get in touch with their school again, as soon as possible.?
In extreme cases, where there is evidence to show that there were circumstances beyond the student¡¯s control which prevented them for contacting their school, a retrospective application for mitigating circumstances may be considered.?
WHAT DO STUDENTS NEED TO DO???
All taught undergraduate and postgraduate students wishing?to?apply for?mitigating circumstances, need to complete?a?Mitigating Circumstances form?and provide supporting evidence?to?their Parent School, even if the module affected is taken in a different school.?
See the?student?pages?for more information about mitigating circumstances.??
WHERE CAN STAFF FIND MORE INFORMATION???
Staff should visit the?Mitigating?Circumstances?web page for more information.??
"
Religious observance,"Our institutional timetable is set to accommodate religious observance where possible. Sometimes issues feel or become more complex at an individual school or service level.
What students need to do?
Students who, for religious reasons, are unable to carry out their university work on a Sabbath or a holy day must advise their school(s) immediately. ?
Where a student's religious commitments prevent them from taking exams on certain days during University assessment periods, they must also?give notice to the Assessment & Progress Team by completing?the?Notification of religious commitments form?by?the last Friday in October for January assessments and by the end of Week 4 of teaching in semester 2 for May/June assessments (see the timeline).
Where exemption is approved, it is the student¡¯s responsibility to ensure they have covered all work from classes that they have missed.
The University will make every effort to avoid arranging assessments on a Sabbath or holy day for those students who have informed the Assessment & Progress Team as required. The University, however, reserves the right to hold assessments?on such days if no alternative time is convenient.?
Further guidance
The Equality Policy Unit provides guidance for staff and students on flexibility on grounds of religion or belief?(PDF) to enable staff to respond in a way which is non-discriminatory. The document offers practical suggestions for handling such requests.
"
Code of Practice on Assessment (taught students),"The University gives general information relating to assessment of students in its code of practice on assessment. Academic schools provide more specific local guidance in their own school code of practice.
University Code of Practice on Assessment

The University will give all students and staff access to the ordinances and regulations and clear and transparent rules for award for all programmes of study.
Schools must have, and update annually, a Code of Practice on Assessment that provides clear information for students and staff on all school assessment policies and practices.
Schools will provide clear information on assessment requirements and deadlines for each module which, as well as being published in handbooks or made available online, will be discussed with students.
Schools will give students the opportunity to develop the skills and acquire the knowledge necessary to meet the assessment requirements in the discipline.
Students will be given the opportunity to undertake formative assessment: that is, work that will allow students and staff to monitor performance.
Schools will seek to ensure, as far as possible, a reasonable spread of assessment deadlines.
Schools will have procedures to securely collect and record the receipt of major pieces of assessed coursework.
Transparent assessment criteria will be available for all forms of assessment so that students can judge their performance against them.
Schools will clearly notify students of the deadlines for the return of assessed work and feedback.
Schools will provide opportunities, within an appropriate timescale, for written and/or oral feedback on all assessed coursework.
Schools will provide the opportunity for students to receive oral feedback, online feedback, model answers or some other appropriate mechanism on performance in assessments.
The school code of practice on assessment will be considered annually by the Student Staff Partnership Forum.
The dean of faculty is responsible for ensuring that schools comply with this code of practice.?

School code of practice on assessment
Each School will have a code of practice on assessment (CoPA) which is based on a University template and describes local arrangements for assessment and related matters. The quality assurance team?annually publishes the approved School CoPAs.?

CoPA template for 2021/22
Approved School CoPAs

"
Regulatory framework,"The Rules for Award, codes of practice on assessment, and programme specifications are the regulations that manage student assessment and the award of qualifications.
 

The Rules for Award are the rules under which schools make awards on behalf of the University.
The University code of practice on assessment sets out the general university requirements for student assessment.
School codes of practice on assessment explain local school practice.
Each programme has a specification, which is recorded in the undergraduate programme catalogue or taught postgraduate programme catalogue, that explains the specific rules for that programme. The catalogue includes full details of the learning outcomes, compulsory and optional modules, and any other requirements for receiving that particular award."
Exclusion from assessment,"There are some circumstances under which a student can be excluded from assessment. In each case, there is a policy to be followed.
Guidance on exclusion
In cases where a student habitually fails to attend teaching, and the unsatisfactory students procedure has been followed, sometimes it is 
appropriate to exclude the student from assessment. Find out more about the circumstances in which a student can be excluded from taught assessment and the procedure that should be followed.
Referred students
Students can be ""referred"" if they have seriously or repeatedly failed examinations. In some instances it is possible for a student to be excluded from the University without previous warning. The referred students procedure explains what to do when a school decides that it will no longer take responsibility for a student who is seriously or repeatedly failing exams and a student's rights on those circumstances.
Cheating and plagiarism
 Cheating and plagiarism is taken very seriously. The cheating, plagiarism, fraudulent or fabricated coursework procedure includes the process to follow in this situation and the penalties the students might face."
Examination process overview,"A summary of the main steps and timescales for the submission and examination of theses to help you know what to expect.
For more detailed information to help supervisors provide the right level of support to their PGRs, please consult the ?Guide to the thesis examination process.?
At least four months before submission

The PGR and supervisor should start thinking about the examination entry process and identifying appropriate examiners for the thesis.

At least three months before submission

The?PGR should?start the?examination entry?workflow in GRAD. Once completed, an email and task will be sent to the?supervisor to complete the nomination for examiners.?
The supervisor should consult the?eligibility criteria for the appointment of examiners?and approach potential examiners.
Once the potential examiners have informally agreed, the supervisor should complete the GRAD workflow with the nominations and submit.
The?workflow is checked by the Graduate School and reviewed by the Director of PGR Studies. It?is then sent to Doctoral College Operations (DCO) to check the eligibility of the proposed examiners before the Examinations Group reviews and approves the recommendation.

Submitting the thesis

In response to the current situation, we have moved to online thesis submission only. ?Theses should be submitted via GRAD as a PDF; soft-bound copies are not required. The?thesis can be submitted and assessed remotely.?
The thesis will be sent to the examiners by email, at the current time. DCO will email the Supervisors to confirm the thesis can be sent by email.
DCO dispatches it to the examiners (usually within ten working days).

The oral examination (viva)

The?PGR attends their oral examination, joined by?one supervisor as an observer if the?PGR wishes.?
Arrangements have been made for it to be possible for PGRs to complete their viva via video streaming, at the current time.? The policy on video stream is available to download.?If a PGR would?prefer to postpone and rearrange the viva, we will be happy to support this - please contact your Graduate School.
All PGRs should consult their supervisor(s) for appropriate guidance in preparation for their submission and examination. A ¡°mock viva¡± may be helpful for some PGRs, and if so, they should again consult their supervisors.?The Guide to the thesis examination process?includes details of the ¡®Preparing for Your Video Streamed Viva using Teams¡¯ sessions that are available to PGRs through ODPL and other information available through the Leeds Doctoral College Minerva organisation.

After the oral examination

The examiners informally notify the candidate of the result (usually immediately, but no more than 24 hours afterwards). They will be given one of the following results: pass (or pass subject to the correction of minor editorial corrections or minor deficiencies), referral or fail.
The examiners prepare an examiners¡¯ report on the viva which is passed to the Director of PGR Studies in the school before forwarding to DCO.
The examiners¡¯ report is considered at the next examinations group meeting. The examiners¡¯ recommendation is always subject to final approval by the examinations group.
Once the internal examiner has approved any corrections, the?PGR can arrange for their eThesis to be submitted?in accordance with the?Guide to the thesis examination process?
Referred candidates will receive individual notes for guidance which outline the required changes to help them prepare to resubmit. These notes must be submitted with the examiners¡¯ report for approval?by the?Examinations Group . The notes will be issued by DCO once they¡¯re approved.?

Deposit of final eThesis

Before the final thesis is submitted, the PGR and supervisor should discuss the thesis retention arrangements for the Library to agree whether the thesis can be made available immediately, or whether a restriction on access is needed. This may be necessary if the work is commercially or politically sensitive, or if there are plans to publish.?
The University has withdrawn the requirement to submit a hard bound copy of a final, corrected thesis for the award of a degree. PGRs only need to upload a PDF copy of the thesis to White Rose Etheses Online. This can be carried out remotely.? Please see the eThesis page for further advice.
If the current situation means a PGR is?not going to be able to meet the deadline for completing any minor corrections to the thesis they can apply for an extension through GRAD, and the University will consider all requests sympathetically

Publication of pass list
A candidate¡¯s name will be published on a pass list after:

the examiners¡¯ report has been approved at a Graduate Board¡¯s Examinations Group meeting
DCO has received confirmation that the internal examiner is satisfied that any required corrections have been completed
The eThesis has been uploaded
any outstanding tuition fees have been paid in full.?

Graduation

Further information about the arrangements for?graduation and certificates?can be found on the?graduation?pages of the?SES website.

Thesis submission,"There are key dates and events to keep in mind while supporting PGRs through the thesis submission process both in the lead up to submission and while submitting the thesis.
Preparing for submission
All candidates should aim to submit their thesis within the standard period of study for their programme. The thesis must be submitted for examination by no later than the end of their maximum period of study. Candidates and supervisors can view this date in GRAD.?
At least four months before the?PGR intends to submit their thesis, PGRs and supervisors should start thinking about the examination entry process and identifying appropriate examiners for the thesis.?Doctoral College?Operations (DCO) needs to receive the examination entry workflow at least three months before the thesis is submitted. You can find further information about the examination entry process and appointment of examiners.
Thesis format regulations
The University has very specific requirements for the format and presentation of the thesis. The Guide to the thesis examination process for?PGRs?includes detailed information on the University requirements for the format and presentation of the thesis and the examination process including:?

entering for examination?
the content and layout of the thesis
the presentation of the title page (PDF) and the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and copyright statements which must be included in the thesis
thesis length requirements, and what to do if there is a need to exceed them
including work from any solely or jointly-authored publications in the thesis
advice on what to expect before, during and after the viva
advice on eThesis preparation and presentation
advice on the presentation of a practice-led submission.

The University has approved an alternative format of thesis submission, which includes?published material, for PGRs in the Faculties of Environment ,?Engineering, Biological Sciences and Medicine and Health only. PGRs and Supervisors?should refer to the Faculty Protocol for further advice.? PGRs in these Faculties?who wish to consider this route to submission are advised to?discuss this with their Supervisory team in the first instance. This model of thesis can only be submitted where the supervisory team supports this format and is satisfied it is appropriate and meets the protocol in place for that Faculty. Please see the Faculty protocol for further advice.
It is recognised that this alternative style of doctoral thesis is not appropriate in all disciplines and that, in some cases and subject areas, the traditional, chapter style of thesis will remain the expected format for the thesis. In all other cases, any published material may be used to form a chapter of a thesis but must be rewritten and integrated within the thesis as a whole ¨C in accordance with the?policy on the use of?solely or jointly-authored publications
Submitting the thesis
In response to the current situation, we have moved to online thesis submission only. ?Theses should be submitted via GRAD as a PDF; soft-bound copies are not required. The thesis can be submitted and assessed remotely.? Further advice on how to do this can be found in the Guide to the thesis examination process for?PGRs?

Dispatch of the thesis to the examiners
DCO?checks the format of the thesis and dispatches it to the examiners (usually within ten working days) - if the examination entry form has been approved by the Examinations Group. The internal examiner is then responsible for making the arrangements for the viva.?

"
The oral examination (viva),"?
At the current time, arrangements have been made to enable PGRs to complete their viva by video streaming, where appropriate, with all parties (PGR, examiners, Independent Chair and supervisor, if attending) completing this process remotely. If a PGR would prefer to postpone and rearrange their viva, the University will be happy to support this, and the Internal Examiner is asked to inform their Graduate School in these cases. The revised video streaming policy is available and we have also prepared a good practice guide for those involved in the process. This includes guidance on the platforms that may be used and details of the OD&PL Team¡¯s viva preparation sessions that are available for internal examiners and Independent Chairs.?Under the video streaming policy, it must be confirmed that pastoral support (normally via the supervisor or other appropriate member of staff, who might be available via video streaming or telephone) will be available to the PGR immediately after the viva, should this be necessary. If the supervisor will not be attending the viva as an observer, they, or other appropriate member of staff (e.g. Director of PGR Studies) must be contactable if needed.
Preparing for the oral examination
The internal examiner arranges the oral examination. The examiners are asked to accept a timescale of three months from when they received the thesis to complete the oral examination (or six months for an MD).?Many?PGRs find the provision of a ""mock viva"" extremely beneficial in the preparation for the oral examination and, where requested by the PGR, the supervisor is asked to organise this.?Please see our Guide to the thesis examination process?for more detailed information about the support available to PGRs in preparation for their viva, including OD&PL Team¡¯s viva preparation sessions that are available at the current time.
The oral examination
The role of the oral examination is to ensure that the work reaches the University standards for the degree; that the work has been written by the?PGR and that they understand the work they have submitted.?
The University does not have specific regulations regarding the length of the oral examination or what should be discussed except that the thesis should be discussed with the PGR. ?The oral examination also gives the candidate the opportunity to answer questions in areas where the examiners are not satisfied. ?Where the evidence in the thesis is not compelling, the examiners should use the oral examination to encourage the candidate to provide convincing evidence that the stated criteria can be met. Some examiners will also wish to satisfy themselves of the candidate¡¯s general level of understanding in the subject area.?
Examiners are provided with good practice advice on the conduct of the oral examination which is available on the instructions to examiners?page.
The role of the supervisor at the viva
PGRs may invite one of their supervisors to be in attendance at their viva as an observer. In cases where a PGR has more than one supervisor, only one supervisor is permitted to attend the oral examination.? A supervisor may only attend with the prior permission of the PGR. If attending as an observer, the supervisor must remain silent during the examination. The Supervisor may not participate in the viva and takes no part in the academic judgement and the decision making process. The Supervisor must leave?after the oral examination (with the PGR) so the examiners can discuss their recommendation. 
If not present as an observer the supervisor (or appropriate individual e.g. Director of PGR Studies or Advisor) is required to be available for contact if necessary.
The role of an independent chair (if appointed)
In some circumstances an independent chair may be appointed for an examination. The role of the independent chair is to ensure that the examination is conducted fairly and professionally, and in accordance with University regulations. The independent chair is not expected to be an expert in the subject area, although they should be from a cognate discipline. As such the independent chair is not expected to read the thesis or play a role in academic examination of the candidate or question the candidate on the work being examined at the oral examination. Further details are given in the Criteria for the appointment of examiners.
An Independent Chair is required for a viva by video streaming.
After the examination
The examiners informally notify the?PGR of the result (usually immediately, but no later than 24 hours afterwards). They will be given one of the following results: pass (or pass subject to editorial and presentational corrections or minor deficiencies), referral or fail. Find out more about the outcome of the viva?and the results a candidate might receive.?
?
"
Instructions to examiners,"All examiners will receive instructions which detail?the University of Leeds examination process and cover their responsibilities and duties of prior to, during and following the viva.
Instructions for all examiners
All examiners appointed to postgraduate research programmes in Leeds will receive full instructions. The instructions cover your responsibilities and duties before, during and after the PGR¡¯s oral examination (viva). They also guide you through filling in the appropriate forms for the examination, including the preliminary report form (before the viva) and the joint, examiners¡¯ report form (after the viva).
The instructions to examiners are applicable to all research degree programmes of study. However they should be read in conjunction with the additional supplement which details the specific criteria for the award, learning outcomes and available recommendations for the particular research degree under examination.??
Criteria for awarding research degrees
The examiners also receive instructions on criteria for award, learning outcomes and available recommendations?of the particular research degree under examination. These instructions are available in the relevant additional information for examiners document.
For details on the formal regulations and requirements for all of the University¡¯s research degrees see regulations, codes, policies and procedures for postgraduate research?and ordinances.
Briefings for external examiners
In some cases, an external examiner will be given a briefing before the viva, for example if the external examiner is based overseas and this will be their first UK postgraduate research?examination. The briefing will be led by a senior member of staff (independent of the supervision and examination team)?who is an experienced examiner at the University and is designed to familiarise the external examiner with the requirements and the expectations of the role. Although a face-to-face meeting is preferred, a telephone briefing is acceptable if this isn¡¯t possible. The guide for external examiner briefings?suggests areas to cover, including the programme structure, advice for before, during and after the viva and some useful links.
Supporting disabled postgraduate students
Disabled PGRs, and their supervisors and examiners, can access a wide range of support from Disability Support. The process for identifying and agreeing support and reasonable adjustments for the final oral examination is set out in a separate document. This document, which is intended to provide a single point of reference for PGRs and staff in Disability Support, Schools/Faculties and DCO:??


Summarises the routine adjustments with clear precedents which can be accommodated without prior approval by the Examinations Group.


?Provides examples of adjustments which may be facilitated with prior approval by Examinations Group, with a framework and timescale for consideration of these


Summarises the support available to?PGRs in preparation for assessment.


It is important that the need for reasonable adjustments is identified well in advance of the final examination to allow due consideration to be given prior to examination. Schools are asked to work in partnership with PGRs, and Disability Support where required, to identify when reasonable adjustments may be required for oral examination; and what those reasonable adjustments might be.?? 
The School is responsible for communicating any agreed adjustments and support arrangements to the PGR, the Supervisor and the examiners.? The Internal Examiner has responsibility for facilitating on the day any reasonable adjustments to the oral examination, which will have been agreed upon in advance.? 
If you have any questions please contact the thesis submission and examination team.
"
Examiner's preliminary report form (before the viva),"Each examiner should read the thesis carefully and independently of the other examiner(s), bearing in mind the criteria for the award of the degree.? Before the oral examination, each examiner must prepare a preliminary report.? This report must contain brief, preliminary thoughts but must not contain any recommendation relating to the award (or not) of the degree. Each examiner must also complete an independent preliminary report form in the case of a resubmission following referral.
Two report templates are provided depending on whether the thesis is a first submission or a resubmission following referral:
Examiner¡¯s preliminary report form - first submission
Examiner¡¯s individual report form ¨C resubmission
The report may be handwritten or typed. ?If handwritten please use black ink/biro and ensure that you write legibly.

Before the oral examination
Each examiner must complete their preliminary report independently of the other examiner(s) before exchange, or discussing the thesis with the other examiner(s). On the day of the oral examination the examiners should arrange to meet together before seeing the PGR in order to decide upon areas for discussion and any issues on which clarification should be sought. The preliminary reports should be discussed by the examiners and will assist them in deciding upon the structure of the examination and in identifying specific topics for discussion. This discussion will enable the Examiners to plan the structure of the oral examination and ensure that all relevant issues are addressed appropriately
After the oral examination
The preliminary reports of all examiners should be attached to the final, joint report of the examiners (prepared after the oral examination) and should be returned to Postgraduate Research and Operations for consideration by the Graduate Board¡¯s Examinations Group.
Preliminary reports are not automatically released to the?PGR but will be released if requested (only after the joint report of the examiners has been considered and approved by the Examinations Group). In the event of an adverse academic decision (referral, MPhil award on PhD or fail) PGRs will be advised that the preliminary reports are available on request.
The instructions to examiners cover in detail the responsibilities and duties of the examiners before, during and after the oral examination (viva), including the requirements for the preliminary report form.

"
Examiners' joint report after the viva,"After the oral examination, the joint examiners¡¯ report should be?completed, signed and countersigned by the Director of PGR Studies?then returned to the Doctoral College Operations (DCO) team.
Notifying the?PGR of the examiners' recommendation
The process of notifying the?PGR and supervisor of the recommendation the examiners are sending forward should normally take place after the viva but, in any event, must take place within 24 hours of the oral examination. It should be made clear that the recommendation is subject to the approval of the Graduate Board¡¯s Examinations Group.
Completing the final joint examiners' report
The final report must be completed immediately after the viva.
The main body of the final report must be typed using the Report templates available.?
The joint report must be countersigned by the Director of PGR Studies (or Head of School). The report can be passed to the Graduate School to arrange for countersignature.?
The report should be returned to your Graduate School within 10 working days of the examination, together with the preliminary reports, and the report from the Independent Chair (if appointed). Where the recommendation is referral, notes for guidance must also be submitted with the report.
Please do not give a copy of the report to the PGR at this stage. The examiners¡¯ report and recommendation must be approved by the Graduate Board¡¯s Examinations Group.
General feedback on the examination process
If examiners wish to submit separate comments or provide any general comment or feedback regarding the examination process which they wish to bring to the attention of the Graduate Board, they are invited to do so by writing to Doctoral College Operations:?rp_examinations@adm.leeds.ac.uk.?
Graduate Board's Examinations Group
The recommendation of the examiners is subject to final approval by the Graduate Board¡¯s Examinations Group. Members consider the content of every report form to establish that the criteria for the award of the degree has been met. The Group may ask for further information if it is not satisfied that the recommendation has been clearly and sufficiently justified or if specific examples are lacking.
Release of the examiners' report to the candidate
The joint examiners¡¯ report will be sent to the candidate and their supervisor(s) by DCO after approval by the Examinations Group. Please bear this in mind when completing your report. Further guidance is given on the instructions to examiners page.
Failure to reach an agreement
In the exceptional circumstances of a failure to reach agreement on the recommendation (within the 24 hour period available) the internal examiner is asked to contact DCO immediately. If the examiners are unable to reach an agreement they must submit separate, independent final reports. For more details, please download the procedure?to be followed.
"
The outcome of the viva (oral examination),"
The examiners' recommendation will normally be given informally to the?PGR (and the supervisor if attending) immediately after the viva (but no more than 24 hours afterwards).

Possible recommendations

After the viva, the examiners must produce a joint report which outlines their recommendation. The recommendation of the examiners is subject to final approval by the Graduate Board¡¯s Examinations Group, which must consider the examiners¡¯ report at its next meeting. The examiners will inform the?PGR (and the supervisor if in attendance ) of the recommendation they are sending forward on the thesis.?

The possible recommendations are:?


Pass: Where the thesis satisfies the requirements for the award and no further corrections are required. The PGR will need to submit the final?eThesis?to the University.
Pass (subject to ""editorial and presentational corrections""): Where the thesis satisfies the requirements for the award of the degree but is found to contain minor editorial and presentational errors (trivial errors, typographical errors, simple mistakes of fact or the insertion of headings or other ¡®signpost¡¯ material for the sake of clarity). The corrections must be completed and returned to the internal examiner for approval within 4 weeks from the viva.
Pass (subject to the correction of minor deficiencies): Where the thesis satisfies the requirements for the award of the degree but is found to contain minor deficiencies (rewriting of sections, correcting calculations or clarifying arguments and the correction of minor typographical errors). The corrections must be completed and returned to the internal examiner for approval within 12 weeks from the viva.
Referral: Where the thesis is potentially of a standard to merit the award of the degree but it does not, at this stage, satisfy the requirements for award. The student will be required to revise their thesis, which may entail further research or any other activity required by the examiners, and resubmit this for re-examination.?Please see the?referral and resubmission page on the SES student site for further guidance.
Fail: If the examiners recommend that a thesis be failed there is no further opportunity to revise and submit the work.?
MPhil award on PhD submission: For PGRs submitting for PhD only, the examiners may recommend the award of MPhil (with or without minor corrections) in cases where the thesis fails to achieve the standard for the award of a PhD but does satisfy the criteria for the award of the degree of MPhil.?


PGRs being examined for MPhil or Mastership by Research may also receive an award with distinction. Such an award is not possible with other research degrees.
To find out more about the recommendations and what a PGR needs to do next, please see the?Guide to the thesis examination process.
"
After successful oral examination,"After the viva, the?PGR must make any necessary corrections to their thesis to the satisfaction of their internal examiner before submitting the final thesis to the University.?Please see our?Guide to the thesis examination process?for more detailed?information.
Correcting the thesis
After a successful oral examination, the PGR should complete any required corrections and return these to their internal examiner for approval. PGRs are advised to consult with their supervisor(s) throughout this process. Once the internal examiner has approved the corrections the final thesis can be prepared.
If a PGR?experiences any problems completing and returning the corrections to the internal examiner by the 4/12 week deadline?they must draw this promptly to the attention of?their Faculty/School PGR Administrator (or? supervisor or Director of PGR Studies).The Graduate Board¡¯s Examinations Group will consider a short extension to the correction deadline if PGRs experience difficulties during the correction period and need extra time because of, for example, illness, work or family commitments.
?For more information about extending correction deadlines, read the policy.
Uploading the final eThesis
The University has permanently withdrawn the requirement for PGRs to submit a hard-bound copy of the corrected thesis for the award of their degree. PGRs only need to upload a PDF copy of their thesis to White Rose Etheses Online. This can be carried out remotely.?Please see our eThesis page for further details.
PGRs must?discuss the retention of thesis arrangements with their supervisor before uploading their eThesis. As part of the eThesis upload process the PGR will be asked to confirm whether their thesis can be made immediately available in the Library or whether an embargo is needed, for example if the work is commercially or politically sensitive or if there are plans to publish. Please see our eThesis page for further details
Supervisors will receive an email notification of the thesis embargo arrangements after the eThesis has been uploaded. If a supervisor has any concerns with the embargo which has been applied - for example if a longer period is required - please contact Doctoral College Operations.
Publication of pass list
A PGR¡¯s name will be published on a pass list after:


The examiners¡¯ report has been approved at a Graduate Board¡¯s Examinations Group meeting.
DCO has received confirmation that the internal examiner is satisfied that any?corrections have been completed.
The PDF e-thesis has been uploaded.
All tuition fees have been paid.

Graduation,"As a member of academic staff, you are invited to attend your school's graduation ceremonies.
This involves wearing the relevant academic dress, being a part of the procession into the Great Hall and sitting on stage during the ceremony.?
Don¡¯t forget we are holding two events this year, the Covid catch up ceremonies for students awarded August 2021 ¨C?March 2022 and the current finalist graduations.??
You can see the schedules here?https://students.leeds.ac.uk/info/10113/graduation?
Before graduation
You can order your gown directly from Ede and Ravenscroft. If you have ordered a gown from Ede and Ravenscroft before, you will automatically receive an email from them with instructions. New staff can email the Graduation Team to request to be set up and will receive instructions by email. Staff do not have to pay to hire the gown to wear as academic staff processing at graduation.?
Once ordered, you will receive an email from Ede and Ravenscroft with your order number and collection instructions.
The deadline to order academic dress for graduation is the 13 June.
If you have missed the registration deadline but still want to attend a ceremony please email the Graduation Team. If you miss the deadline to order a gown you can borrow a plain black gown from Ede and Ravenscroft on the day.
Ede and Ravenscroft will make every effort to supply the correct academic dress for overseas degrees. However, this is not always possible and they may have to provide substitute dress.
On the day
You can collect your gown from 8am in UG09 in the Great Hall.?
Please report to UG09 in the Great Hall?at least?20 minutes before the ceremony start time. Before you enter the hall you will be instructed to line up for the procession.
When you're in the Great Hall, you will be led on to the stage and seated for the duration of the ceremony (usually 45 minutes). When the ceremony is declared closed, you will be led out of the Great Hall as part of the recession.
"
Certificates and transcripts,"Certificates and transcipts are available to students once they have graduated from their programme of study. They are both produced through a centralised process. 
Degree certificate 
A student will receive a degree certificate either in person at their graduation or in the post if they are not attending the ceremony.
Producing the certificates is a centralised process. Students have the chance to check their details online and request a replacement or copy if required.
 The only information on a degree certificate is a student's name, programme of study, classification and award date.
Transcript
If a student requires a breakdown of their marks and modules, they can apply for a transcript (included in a Higher Education Academic Record) through the online store.
Higher Education Academic Record (HEAR)
At graduation all undergraduate students will also receive their Leeds for Life Higher Education Achievement Record (LfL HEAR). This includes their academic transcript as well as a record of University prizes and University-validated significant achievements. Students can also access their LfL HEAR on the Leeds for Life website

Programme and module related questions
?

What does the term ¡°level¡± mean?
Level refers to the level of a module and its credits.
For example:

CHEM1002 - a level 1 module with a credit value of 20?? i.e. 20 level-1 credits
BIOC2667 - a level 2 module with a credit value of 10
CIVE3772 - a level 3 module with a credit value of 40? i.e. 40 level-3 credits
LUBS5778M - a level M module with a credit value of 30
FLTU1559 - a level 1 module with a credit value of 10 which can be taken in any year of study that the programme specification allows.

This is also explained in the Rules for Award.
?
What does the term ¡°year¡± mean?
Year (called Class in the Classification Tool) is the study (Academic) year that a student studies.??Programmes are made up of modules and credits to a predetermined standard and are designed to run over a number of study years.
For example:

First year of study on BA English
A second year student on the BSc Math programme?
Penultimate year of study on BEng
Final year of study on BA Education (part-time) ¨C which could be the student¡¯s 6th year of study.

This is also explained in the?Rules for Award.
?
How many credits can a student study?
Undergraduate full time students must study 120 credits per year on a full-time programme.
Taught Postgraduate full time students must study a minimum of 180 credits, of which at least 135 must be ¡®M' level credits.
Refer to Modules and programmes explained,?the?Rules for Award and/or the Ordinances for more information.
How many attempts does a student have to pass a module?
Undergraduate students who have a start date prior to academic term 2016/2017 are permitted three attempts to pass a module; the first attempt plus up to two resits.
?

Original attempt ¨C at the end of Semester One or Semester Two depending on the teaching of the module.
2nd attempt - in the August Re-examination/Assessment period following their original attempt, unless the school has specifically precluded them from their 2nd opportunity due to failure to make a serious attempt at the original opportunity.
3rd and final attempt ¨C may be taken the following session when the module is offered as an external or carried module, unless exceptional circumstances permit internal re-sit.

?
Undergraduate students who have a start date in academic term 2016/2017 are permitted two attempts to pass a module; the first attempt plus one resit.
?

Original attempt ¨C at the end of Semester One or Semester Two depending on the teaching of the module.
2nd and final attempt - in the August Re-examination/Assessment period following their original attempt.

?
An exception to this rule is International Foundation year students who studied their foundation year in academic year 2015/2016. These students will continue under the old regulations and will be permitted three attempts to pass a module; the first attempt plus up to two resits.
All taught postgraduate students are permitted two attempts to pass a module.
?

Original attempt ¨C at the end of Semester One or Semester Two depending on the teaching of the module.
2nd attempt - in the August Re-examination/Assessment period or the following session depending on the timing of the original attempt.? Guidance must be sought from the parent school.? If the student does not attend the re-sit at the next opportunity, as stated by the school, the student will lose that final attempt and be marked Absent.?

?
Refer to Resit eligibility and registration for more information.
How does a student enrol for their original attempt?
When registering with the University, the student will automatically be registered for all of their compulsory examinations/assessments for the programme of study they have chosen.?
Refer to When to enrol on your modules?on the For Students site for further information on modules and how and when to enrol on to modules.
When can a student change a module?
If, after the start of any semester's teaching, a student is considering a change in the modules that make up their programme of study, they should discuss the matter with an appropriate member of academic staff in their Parent School. A Change of Module form will need to be signed by their Parent School. Once signed, their Parent School will arrange for the change to be considered by any other teaching school affected. The change will only be authorised when all the schools agree.
Whether or not the student is permitted to change a module is likely to depend on a number of factors, including whether or not:

Their attendance record is satisfactory
Spare capacity is available in the receiving module
There is sufficient time for the student to catch up on any teaching or coursework assignments which have been missed.

?
Modules may not be changed after the fourth week of teaching unless there are exceptional circumstances; if agreed, any changes after week 4 are subject to a ¡ê50 administration charge. Refer to the Change of module?on the Students SES site for more information.?
If a student transfers to a different programme of study, do they have to study 120 credits if they have already achieved some of the relevant credits?
Where a student transfers in credits against a programme ¨C they are exempted from those credits and do not have to pick up a full diet.
For example:
Masters programme of 180 credits, students can transfer in up to 60 credits, and just study the remaining 120 credits.? They do not need to top up to 180 credits with other modules.? Refer to Transfer to a new programme for more information.

Assessment related questions including resits, resit fees, external and overseas assessments
?

When are the University assessment periods?
There are usually three University assessment periods each year - one at the end of each semester and a re-assessment period before the Summer Bank Holiday weekend in late August. During the academic year 2020/21, an assessment period?will also be held in September, and for some cohorts, assessments will be arranged by schools at other times.? See Assessment Timetables for more information.
Assessments may be held on any of the days within the published assessment period, including weekends but excluding Bank Holiday Mondays.
Students are required to be available for all assessment sessions. (NB. Although the University timetable does not schedule assessments on Bank Holidays, the University reserves the right to re-schedule assessments on a Bank Holiday if necessary).
Refer to Assessment periods and timetable publication dates for further information.
When is an undergraduate student eligible to re-sit?
If a student does not pass enough credits or does not meet their programme requirements to be eligible to progress to the next year of study, they may be eligible to re-sit failed modules in the August re-assessment period, provided that a serious attempt at the exam in January or May/June was made and their teaching school has not excluded them from doing so (indicated by an ¡°S¡± next to the grade).
Undergraduate students who have a start date prior to academic term 2016/2017 are permitted a third and final attempt which must be taken the following session when the module is offered as an external or carried module, unless exceptional circumstances permit internal re-sit.
Undergraduate students who have a start date in academic term 2016/2017 are permitted only two attempts to pass a module; the first attempt plus one resit (August re-assessment period).
Finalists who have either a) failed the degree or b) achieved sufficient credits for the award of the Ordinary degree and are eligible to re-sit failed modules to upgrade their classification to Honours, are permitted to re-sit at the next offering of the failed module.
Any re-sit?has to be taken at the next opportunity, and failure to do so will result in the loss of an attempt. Marks for modules which are not taken will be classified as Absent.
If the student has been granted a ""first attempt"" re-sit, they will need to confirm with their parent school if they wish to take it.? If they accept the opportunity to re-sit as a ""first attempt"", their original mark will be expunged and their result for the re-sit will apply, even if it is lower than their original mark.? Students should contact their Parent School to find out further information on ""first attempts"".
Refer to Resits?for further information.
?
When is a taught postgraduate student eligible to re-sit?
Any re-sit has to be taken at the next opportunity, and failure to do so will result in the loss of an attempt. Marks for modules which are not taken will be classified as Absent.
If a student has failed a module they may retake it in August depending on if the re-sit is offered by the teaching school, and depending on their cohort (See Assessment Timetables for more information on cohorts).? Students must take advice from their schools as to when the re-assessment is offered.?
Refer to?Resits?for further information
What are the rules for students taking re-sits Internally/Externally?
All undergraduate students are entitled to a re-sit in August (unless specifically precluded by the school).?
Following the August re-assessment period, if an Undergraduate student with a start date prior to academic term 2016/2017, has failed a module which is a must pass to progress module, or the student has not achieved sufficient credits to progress, then the student must become an external student the following session.?
If the Undergraduate student has a start date in academic term 2016/2017 they are only permitted two attempts to pass a module.? If the student has failed a module which is a must pass to progress module, or the student has not achieved sufficient credits to progress, having been unsuccessful in their final attempt, they have exhausted all attempts and will therefore be required to withdraw from the University of Leeds.
Only in exceptional circumstances may a student be allowed to re-sit internally.??The exceptional circumstances may be:

The student has missed too much teaching to make any progress without further teaching.
The student has failed a laboratory module (element) and needs to use the laboratory facilities to be able to pass.
The student had mitigating circumstances and has been permitted to expunge the results of the year and retake the whole year internally as first attempts.? Refer to External/Carried module resits for more information.

?
How does a student apply to re-sit?
The student must submit their re-sit application online via the Results and re-sit Application page (available through the Minerva using their University username and password from the beginning of July).? They must apply for any module which has any assessment?they want to re-sit. They will be able to apply to re-sit by selecting ¡®Yes¡¯ next to the modules that they have failed and are eligible to re-sit. Their application will be recorded on Banner and processed by the Assessment &?Progress team.?
Refer to?Resits?for further information, including the deadlines for applications to be submitted.
Undergraduate Finalists should refer to the?Resits?page for the deadline for applications. After the published deadline, if students are eligible for an award and have not applied to resit, they will be deemed to have accepted the award.
Taught Postgraduates?wishing to apply to resit modules (where the results are provisional) must:

Download a re-sit Application Form from the Provisional Marks page (via the Minerva).
Fill out the form listing all modules they want to re-sit, including any which are re-assessed by coursework only. If they do not register for all re-assessments before the deadline for re-sit applications, they may be charged the increased administration fee.
Email the completed form to the Assessment?&?Progress Team.?

Non-finalists?and Taught Postgraduates can still apply after the deadline by emailing the Assessment & Progress team. Applications received after the deadline will be subject to an increased administration fee.? For on-campus assessments, students will only be allocated a seat number?if they submit their application by the deadline. If they apply after this, ad-hoc arrangements will be made when they arrive on the day.
Undergraduate Finalists?who are eligible for an award will be deemed to have accepted it if they have not applied to resit by their deadline.? Late applications won't be accepted.
?
When is the re-assessment period?
Re-sit assessment dates
Re-sit assessments generally take place in August (during the two weeks prior to the August bank holiday).??(See Assessment Timetables for more information on cohorts).
Unfortunately it isn't possible to find out the exact date of an assessment before the students apply to re-sit. This is because the timetable is produced once the information is known of which modules students have applied for.
Students should view their personal assessment timetable via Minerva (see Assessment Timetable publication dates).
Students should check that they have been entered for the appropriate exams, and tell the Assessment & Progress Team immediately about any discrepancies.?
Please refer to Assessment periods and timetable publication dates for further information.
Assessed-work deadlines
Students should contact their school directly to find out the deadlines for submitting assessed work.
Cancelling a re-sit application
Students should email the Assessment &?Progress Team to cancel a re-sit application.
Students may only cancel up until the start of the relevant?assessment period. After this, their application will stand and any re-sit fees will still be charged. Students will lose an attempt if they do not take the re-sit.?
Refer to?Resits?for further information.
How much are the re-sit fees?
If the exam is a ¡°first attempt¡±, there are no fees.
If the exam is not a ¡°first attempt¡±, the re-sit fees are:
¡ê2.00 per credit (i.e. ¡ê20.00 for a 10 credit module)
plus
¡ê50.00 administration fee (increases to ¡ê100 after the deadline). This is a one-off fee, which is the same regardless of how many modules the student takes.
Fees for re-sits taken in August will be charged to the student¡¯s University account after 31 July. Fees for re-sits taken at other times of the year will be charged after the application has been processed.? You will receive a statement of fees by email and must pay immediately.? Failure to pay will result in late payment administration charges of ¡ê20 per month until the debt is repaid in full.? For further information, refer to http://www.leeds.ac.uk/students/waystopay and?Resits.
Can a student take their re-sit assessment abroad?
Students may be eligible to sit their re-sit (or approved further first attempt) assessment abroad if:

The student's home address is outside of the UK and the assessments are taken in their home country.
The student is working or studying abroad as part of their programme.
The student is studying here as an exchange student and returning home.

If the student lives outside the UK, the location that they apply to resit at must be in their home country. The assessment must be suitable to be taken outside the University and a suitable assessment environment must be available (e.g. British Council; home university).
If eligible the Assessment &?Progress Team will process the application.? If the student does not fall into any of the above category they will be advised to submit a further case to their Parent School, explaining their reason.?
The SSCC should hear the case and reach a decision on whether or not to permit the student to take the assessment overseas.? The assessment must be suitable to be taken outside the University, and a suitable assessment environment must be available (e.g. British Council; Home University).
Schools need to inform the student and the Assessment & Progress Team of the SSCC¡¯s decision.? If permission to take the assessment overseas is granted, the Assessment & Progress Team will liaise with the student and the relevant hosting institution and make the necessary arrangements.?
Please refer to Taking assessments?abroad?for more information.
?
What happens when an Exchange/Erasmus student studying in Semester 1 only, has to return home before they have taken their assessments?
If the student is on an exchange programme and there is a clash between the University of Leeds assessment times and the student¡¯s home university¡¯s teaching patterns, the student must contact their Parent School as soon as possible.
If they are studying modules that are assessed by a formal assessment in January and the start date of Semester 2 at their home university clashes with the January assessment session, they are usually allowed to take their January assessments at their home university.? However, occasionally the format of an assessment dictates that it must be taken in Leeds.
They must print out and complete the ¡°Application to take January assessments at your home University¡± form*, and also obtain?approval from their home university, providing an official letter from them confirming the dates, check with the teaching school for each of their modules that assessment can be taken away from Leeds, and get a signature and a stamp on the form.? They must scan the form and any supporting evidence and submit this to the Assessment & Progress Team by the deadline.?
*Please refer to?Taking assessments?abroad?for more information.
What are the fees for taking an assessment abroad?
If the student is given permission to take their assessment abroad, they must pay:
An overseas administration charge of ¡ê50 to the University of Leeds, plus the standard re-sit assessment fees of ¡ê2 per credit (i.e. ¡ê20 for a 10 credit module) + ¡ê50 administration fee (increased to ¡ê100 after the deadline for re-sit applications) if they are re-sits.
Any charges levied by the hosting institution.??
Please refer to?Taking assessments?abroad?for more information.
What can be done if a student is ill during an assessment, or has mitigating circumstances that affects their academic performance?
If a student has experienced mitigating circumstances during the examinations and/or assessment of their modules, they are entitled to submit a case and supporting evidence to their Parent School.
The school will hold a Schools Special Cases Committee (SSCC) where the case is heard.? If the committee agree that the circumstances have impacted on the student¡¯s ability to study, complete coursework on time, take examinations or perform as expected in an exam,? the committee can agree to expunge the mark achieved for that module and allow the student to retake the module for a true mark (as a first attempt) at the next opportunity.
The school should notify the student of the decision and ensure the student is fully aware that to accept the first attempt means the original mark is expunged.? The student must confirm to the school, in writing, their wish to accept/decline the first attempt.
The school should notify (through the Progression Tool report) the Assessment & Progress Team, who update Banner to show that a first attempt has been granted and accepted.? There is no cost for first attempts.
Once the school notifies the Assessment & Progress Team that the student has accepted the first attempt the system is updated and the original mark is expunged.? Note: if the student then fails to attend the assessment or submits the required work and attains a lower mark, the new mark or a mark of Absent will be recorded and stand.
Can a student retake a module they have already passed?
If a student passes a module, but fails a certain component of the module, and have also been granted a first attempt re-sit,?the student?may re-sit the failed component.??
Only when special permission is granted by the University Special Cases Committee due to mitigating circumstances will a student be allowed to retake a module previously passed where no component is failed.

What are supernumerary modules and how many can students take?
Supernumerary modules are modules chosen by students for interest only and are taken as extra credits on top of the normal amount of credits for the year (i.e. over 120 credits in any undergraduate Programme Year or over 180 in any postgraduate Programme Year).? This means the credits gained in supernumerary modules cannot be counted for progression (e.g. a student passing 70 credits plus a 10-credit supernumerary module is not permitted to include the supernumerary credits to give them the 80 credits required to progress) or classification purposes.
?
Where any supernumerary modules (i.e. over 120 credits in any undergraduate Programme Year or over 180 in any postgraduate Programme Year) are required to meet the learning outcomes of a specific programme, the rule as to whether these credits count for classification should be stated in the Programme Specification and made clear in corresponding material for students. Where students opt to take supernumerary modules outside of the Programme Specification these do not count towards classification.
Students are permitted to register for up to 20 credits of supernumerary modules each year (at the discretion of the parent school) and schools must inform the Exams and Progress team of the choice at the beginning of the session and before the deadline for changing modules*. Supernumerary modules will be recorded on Banner with a status of SN and marks gained for such modules will appear on official transcripts.? Refer to Supernumerary modules for further guidance.
*See the Timeline of Events for deadlines.
?
What are Ad-hoc/ad personam programmes?
In exceptional circumstances it may be necessary to make time-limited amendments to a programme of study.
Where these circumstances relate to one student or a small number of individual students, the amended programme is referred to as an ad personam programme variation.
Where the circumstances relate to an entire cohort of students, it is an ad hoc programme variation.?
Any ad personam or ad hoc programme variation is subject to the approval of the relevant Pro Dean for Student Education, acting on behalf of the Faculty Taught Student Education Committee (FTSEC).
The Head of School must make a case for an ad personam or an ad hoc programme and forward this onto the Exams and Progress team, who will seek approval from the Pro Dean for Student Education.
Refer to Ad personam and ad hoc programme variation process for further guidance.
What drives the Assessment & Progress Team deadlines?
Due to the University Assessment been a cyclical process, operating towards precise tight deadlines, the Assessment & Progress Team are bound by the dates published in the Timeline of Events.? This is produced in accordance with the forward planner which is approved by the Senate.? The organisation and planning required to work around the academic calendar whilst adhering to the deadlines published in the timeline is considerable.
?
The Timeline of Events is published on the web, and is a tool for all staff to use to be informed of the various deadlines that have to be met.
The timeline incorporates the deadlines for three teams of Programmes and Assessment ¨C the Events, the Operations and the Assessment & Progress Teams.
The main drives to the Assessment & Progress Team deadlines are the assessment periods and the end of the year, when the results and pass lists have to be published.

Collaborative provision withdrawal,"The withdrawal of a collaborative arrangement follows a different process to internal provision and varies depending on the category of arrangement.
The withdrawal of a collaborative arrangement carries greater significance compared to standard provision owing to its legal governance. To ensure that all relevant parties are consulted and that the withdrawal process accords with the legal agreement and, where relevant, the student protection plan submitted to the Office for Students, schools must complete a collaborative arrangement withdrawal form.
In the case of off-campus, joint delivery and advanced arrangements (see types of collaborative arrangements (PDF)), the standard programme withdrawal form and a withdrawal action plan (appended to the collaborative arrangement withdrawal form) should also be completed.?
It should be noted that in all cases, termination of the legal agreement ¨C and, by definition, the arrangement itself ¨C is only official when a formal withdrawal letter is sent to the partner. This letter must be drafted by the University Legal Team in consultation with the Quality Assurance Team and the International Office (for international partnerships).??

Following STSEC approval, the school/faculty will liaise with the Quality Assurance Team and International Office (in the case of an international partnership) in preparing the official withdrawal letter.?
WITHDRAWAL OF OFF-CAMPUS, JOINT DELIVERY AND ADVANCED ARRANGEMENTS
Schools/faculties must complete: (1) the standard programme withdrawal form; (2) the template collaborative arrangement withdrawal form, and (3) the withdrawal action plan. The withdrawal will be approved by the School Taught Student Education Committee and the Collaborative Programme Approval Group (the programme withdrawal form should also be sent to the Faculty Programme Approval Group). Once approved, the school/faculty should liaise with the Quality Assurance Team and International Office (in the case of an international partnership) in preparing the official withdrawal letter. The withdrawal will be reported to the Collaborations and Partnerships Committee.
ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR COLLABORATIVE WITHDRAWAL
Schools/faculties should be aware that the termination of all collaborative arrangements is subject to a notice period, the exact duration of which will be specified in the legal agreement.
It is expected that the school/faculty, either directly or via the International Office, will engage with the partner promptly and regularly throughout the withdrawal process to ensure there is a mutual understanding of the responsibilities each side must meet and to manage reputational impact.
Obligations and responsibilities to the students (current or expectant) entering the University through the partnership agreement must continue to be met until the last remaining student(s) have completed the programme. Schools/faculties should therefore be aware that the exit timeframe for a collaborative arrangement may be longer than for international provision.?

Approval process overview,"Compile full details of all new and amended modules and programmes before putting them forward for approval by the appropriate committees.
Approval processes and roles ¨C who does what 
Formal approval involves several groups:

The?Portfolio Steering Group?(PSG) ratifies the teaching portfolio, on behalf of the Senate. 
The School Taught Student Education Committees (STSECs) and Programme Approval Groups (PAGs)?consider the detail of programmes and modules, on behalf of PSG. 
The school proposing the new or changed course is responsible for the completeness and accuracy of each proposal. 
The school and its STSEC ensure that proposals put forward for approval are correct and complete at the first presentation. 
PAGs oversee proposals and focus on selected academic elements, in particular, learning outcomes and methods of assessment. 

Approval procedure
The approval procedure for the different types of proposal are set out below. 
You need full details of all new and amended modules and programmes before you put them forward for approval by the appropriate committees. New programmes and major programme amendments have a two-stage development and approval process - executive approval (stage 1) followed by full academic programme approval (stage 2).
Students will not be able to enrol on a module or register on a programme until it has been fully approved. A new programme should not be included in Integrated Planning Exercise (IPE) submissions until executive approval has been given. 
New programmes:?Require executive approval from the faculty executive before the proposal can be developed for full academic programme approval. New programmes are?proposed by the STSEC, approved by the PAG, and ratified by PSG. The programme proposal requires full academic approval in advance of Coursefinder going live to take full advantage of the recruitment cycle. A Quality Check is undertaken at least 6 months before the programme commences (normally by the appropriate PAG).? At the Quality Check any new constituent module proposals are approved, programme management arrangements are agreed, and the original programme documentation is reviewed to ensure that any issues have been addressed and all elements of the programme are fully aligned and deliverable.? Major programme amendments: involve changes to the structure of an existing programme which have the potential to impact on the programme level learning outcomes.? See major programme amendment definition (PDF). Major programme amendments are proposed by the STSEC, approved by the PAG, and ratified by PSG.
Minor programme amendments: are approved by the STSEC and confirmed to FTSEC via the Report of STSEC Business and supporting STSEC minutes.
New modules: are proposed by the STSEC and approved by the PAG.
Module amendments: are approved by the STSEC and reported to FTSEC via the Report of STSEC business. If the proposed amendments include changes to the module learning outcomes, credit level or weighting you may need to propose a new module instead.? Please speak to your?faculty portfolio manager who will advise on the proposal.??
Indicative programme approval timeframe
This is based on the assumption that executive approval?has been?granted




?Full academic programme approval?completed?


?Quality Check and Review?




Undergraduate programme

PAG meeting?by the end of January, 20 months before programme commences
?PAG meeting or separate Quality Check meeting in Semester 2 (by March, 6 months before the programme commences)



Postgraduate programme

PAG meeting 15 months before the programme commences. 
?PAG meeting or separate Quality Check meeting in Semester 2 (by March, 6 months before the programme commences)



New programme proposals
Proposals for new undergraduate programmes need full academic approval in advance of UCAS going live, by the end of January?2 0 months before the programme commences.? Proposals for new taught postgraduate programmes need full academic approval 15 months?before the programme commences. Please speak to your faculty portfolio manager who will advise on the proposal timescales. 
Changes to modules and programmes
All changes to existing modules and programmes need to be completed by 31 March in the academic year before enrolment/registration. This is so the catalogues are accurate before online enrolment for returning students starts, in early May. 
By 31 March the final versions of the module(s) or programme(s) must be entered into the catalogues and approved by the relevant committees. Schools may not normally make changes to the catalogues for the next session after this date, as the University must meet requirements for the Competition and Markets Authority.
Changes to existing provision during or after online enrolment
In exceptional circumstances, a school may need to make an urgent change to a module or programme after the 31 March deadline. This will only be allowed where the school can prove an urgent need for the change and students will not be disadvantaged.?The Pro-Dean for Student Education in the Faculty or PAG Chair will need to consider the proposal for approval, ensuring the appropriate process has been followed: 

For existing modules, the school will inform all students enrolled on the module of the proposed changes, providing evidence of this and that students agreed to the change.? 
For changes to existing programmes, the school will inform all students registered on the programme of the proposed changes, providing evidence of this and that students agreed to the change. 

Changes to new programmes during the recruitment process


For any proposed changes to new programmes, you should seek advice from your faculty portfolio manager as early as possible.? These may then be considered by Chair¡¯s action or as part of the programme¡¯s Quality Check by the PAG.? If approved, the relevant Faculty Admissions team will then contact all applicants to the programme to inform them of the changes and where appropriate, offer advice about alternative arrangements and the opportunity to withdraw.??


Module and programme catalogues 
The module and programme catalogues are the definitive source of information on the University's teaching portfolio. They contain the formal programme specifications. It is vital they are accurate because:

students, examiners and others rely on the information in catalogues 
several other systems get their information from the catalogues, including: 
      
websites? 


online enrolment and registration? 


the Banner student records system? 


University examinations? 


Minerva. ? 



The School is responsible for ensuring that final details of? all approved modules and programmes are?entered into the catalogues following approval. This should be completed within 5 working days of the programme/module being approved. 
Responsibility for accuracy
Schools and faculties are responsible for ensuring that the catalogue information is accurate and complete, and that information provided to staff and students by other means matches that in the catalogue. Students, examiners and others must be able to rely on the information published in the programme specifications.
Guidance and training for using the module and programme catalogues
Group training is organised by the SIMS team on selected?dates throughout the?year.?Full information about these courses can be found on the IT website.??
One to?one sessions can be arranged throughout the year by contacting the?Catalogue Manager. ?
Recording changes
Keep full records of all changes to a school¡¯s modules and programmes in the minutes of STSEC meetings.? Following STSEC, a consolidated report of all module amendments and minor programme amendments that have been approved by STSEC (along with the STSEC minutes) will be submitted to your faculty portfolio manager for reporting at the next FTSEC meeting. 
Report of STSEC business?for FTSEC: module amendmentsReport of STSEC business?for FTSEC: minor programme amendments.?"
Taught module approval,"New or? amended modules require certain actions and approvals before they can be offered. New modules are approved by the Programme Approval Group.? Amended modules are approved by the School Taught Student Education Committee.
Modules are the individual units of study. With other modules, they make up a programme. Successful completion of specified modules leads to the award defined for the programme.
Each module will have its own learning outcomes, syllabus and assessment schedule. The Programme Approval Group (PAG) approves new modules on the recommendation of the School Taught Student Education Committee (STSEC). Following PAG approval of a new module, the STSEC has authority to approve minor amendments to the module and report these to the Faculty Taught Student Education Committee?(FTSEC).
Types of module
The different types of module in the University are:
Compulsory module
These are modules which must be taken to be able to progress with a programme or to be eligible for award. They contain the essential parts of the programme and so are compulsory to enable the learning outcomes for the programme to be met.
Optional module
Optional modules support achievement of the programme learning outcomes and form part of the approved programme specification. A list of possible optional modules will be stated for each programme of study and students on the programme can choose modules from this list.
Discovery module
A discovery module is one which is not required for achievement of the programme learning outcomes and is not therefore specified as part of a programme of study. Discovery modules are designed to give a student the opportunity to broaden their studies if they wish. Some programmes do not allow students to take discovery modules because of professional requirements. Students in their final programme year will not normally be permitted to take year 1 modules unless they are skills discovery modules (see below).
See also Discovery Themes and Discovery Modules as a feature of Broadening in the Leeds Curriculum.
?
Criteria for the designation of a module as a Discovery Module
To be designated as a Discovery Module, a module must:

Be designed to provide opportunity for the development of one or more of the agreed?University list of skills and attributes;
Be no more than 20 credits in size, this being the maximum entitlement to take Discovery Modules in the final year of an undergraduate programme;
Have sufficient capacity that places on the module will be available to students during Discovery enrolment;
Usually have no pre-requisites; where they are necessary, they should be straightforward, broad, limited to one level and attainable while studying at Leeds prior to the student's final programme year;
Be approved by the appropriate Discovery Theme Leader(s) for inclusion in the Discovery Theme(s).?Please email your completed module proposal?form to: Discovery@leeds.ac.uk

See further information?about Discovery Themes and Broadening?on the Broadening website.
Discovery Modules will be reviewed on an annual basis using the criteria listed above.
Skills discovery module
Skills discovery modules are designed to develop specific skills. They can be taken in any year of the student¡¯s programme. Year 1 skills discovery modules are the only year 1 modules which can be taken beyond the second programme year. A maximum of 20 credits, subject to the provisions of the programme of study concerned, may be taken in the final programme year. Skills discovery modules are always single-weighted in the classification algorithm. Skills discovery modules can be at year 1, year 2 and exceptionally year 3.
Changes to modules
What is a new module?
A new module is one that has not been offered previously in the same form in the University.
A module that has been substantially amended (eg changes to the?credit weighting,?credit level or substantive changes to the module learning outcomes) should be treated as a new module. This ensures the accuracy of a student¡¯s Diploma Supplement and Transcript document and Higher Education Achievement Report.
New modules must always be:

given a new module code that has not been used before
recommended for approval by the STSEC and be formally approved by the relevant PAG.

Consistent opportunity and assessment
For each module, all students must have identical opportunities for learning and study, and experience identical assessment opportunities. If, within a single cohort of students on a module, it is proposed to assess some students by one method (eg an exam) and others by a different method (eg a coursework essay), these alternatives must be treated as separate modules and be presented to students through the programme catalogue as alternative modules.
Approval process
Preparing a new module proposal for STSEC
New module proposals are recommended for approval by the STSEC and approved by the PAG. Follow the process below:??

Use the proposal form for a module which includes accompanying guidance to help ensure you have considered everything you need to.?
Check that the Head of School has considered the outline proposal for the module to ensure that it is consistent with school/faculty strategy and is financially sustainable. If a reading list is required, module leaders should provide this through the reading list tool in Minerva (see the Library's reading list guidance page for more information). If a reading list is not required, this should be signalled in the reading list tool, which will populate the space with appropriate online library guides.
The STSEC considers the new module proposal and recommends approval or revisions to be made.
Following STSEC, ensure the module proposal is updated to reflect the revisions agreed by STSEC. You can enter the module onto the catalogue now or wait until it has full approval from the PAG.

After STSEC endorsement
Submit the module proposal electronically to your Quality Assurance team (QAT) faculty contact, with the relevant STSEC minutes detailing consideration of the proposal and a completed PAG coversheet. QAT then? arranges for it to be considered for approval by the relevant PAG.
Once the PAG has approved the module the School must ensure that the final version of the module is added to the module catalogue. QAT will then authorise it being made live on the catalogue.
Students may only enrol on a module when it is live on the catalogue.
Module amendments
STSECs have authority to approve module amendments and then report these to FTSEC via the STSEC business report and STSEC minutes.? (A copy of the amended module is not required by FTSEC).
All module amendments can be approved by STSEC except where the proposed amendments are considered major and affect the?credit weighting, credit?level or require substantive amendments to the learning outcomes. In such instances, a new module must be proposed and the existing module withdrawn.?? The replacement module is treated as a new module for approval purposes. This retains the integrity and consistency of the historical record of modules and ensures parity for any student retaking a module in a future year.
Changing a module title is considered a minor change and can be approved by STSEC, however the re-titled module requires a new module code to retain consistency of the historical record. The existing module code will need to be withdrawn and the new module code and title confirmed to the Faculty TSEC in the report of?STSEC business.?
Process for amending modules

The changes to the module must be clearly indicated with a supporting rationale.? This proposal is then considered for approval by the STSEC.?
A module catalogue report or amended module proposal can be provided if this is considered appropriate for STSEC consideration.
Following approval, the module catalogue must be updated to reflect the changes.
The module amendments must be reported to the FTSEC through the STSEC business report and the STSEC minutes, which must be sent to your Quality Assurance team (QAT) faculty contact.??

Please contact your Quality Assurance team (QAT) faculty contact if you have any queries regarding the process.
Typographical corrections
Typographical corrections are changes which affect the layout, expression, spelling and/or grammar of text fields, but which do not change the meaning of the text. Examples include correcting spelling, punctuation or grammar, paragraph layout or bullet points. Typographical corrections do not include any addition or removal of content. Typographical corrections can be made without committee approval. The catalogue retains a record of versions and usernames, where changes are made.
Open fields
Open fields impact the operational delivery of modules but do not affect the nature of study or the student achievement. Changes to information in these fields do not require academic committee approval but are usually subject to management approval within the parent School. These open fields are:

Staff
HECoS code(s)
Teaching periods, including part of term (semester) and caps on enrolment numbers, providing that the changes do not significantly change the structure of approved programmes.

""In principle"" approval of new or amended modules
It is occasionally necessary to approve a new or amended module ¡°in principle¡± before full information is available, for example, to facilitate advertising a new programme or online enrolment. Modules for ¡°in principle¡± approval should be submitted with as much information as possible. As a minimum the following information must be provided: title, level, module code, credit weighting and semester of delivery (and this can be included in the programme proposal form). Before teaching starts, the full module proposal must be formally approved by the STSEC and PAG through the normal channels.
Withdrawal of a module
A module that is not a compulsory element of any programme and for which no students are registered for the next session may be withdrawn for the next and/or subsequent sessions. To withdraw a module the STSEC should include its termination in their meeting minutes and in the completed report of STSEC business?to FTSEC.
Where a module is a compulsory or optional part of a programme, the school should include recommendations for necessary amendments to the programmes affected.? If appropriate, the School should also?give students details of alternative modules that are available.
If students have registered for a module before it is considered for withdrawal the STSEC must consult the Pro-Dean for Student Education. The module can be withdrawn only after evidence has been supplied that all students registered on the module have been notified and have made satisfactory alternative module choices.
A module that is a compulsory or optional element in any programme owned by another school may be withdrawn only with approval of the FTSEC and after discussion with the parent school(s) for the programmes concerned.
Temporary suspension of a module (eg because of staff sabbaticals) is known as making it inactive. A compulsory module in any programme cannot be made inactive.
"
Taught programme approval,"New or changed programmes must get formal approval before they are offered. The time this takes depends on the change and the programme. Get specific advice as early as possible from your?faculty portfolio manager.
A programme is a specified suite of academic modules leading to an award of the University.
Programmes are specified in detail in the programme catalogue. They must be ratified by the Portfolio Steering Group (PSG), which acts on the advice of Programme Approval Groups (PAGs) and School Taught Student Education Committees (STSECs).
New or amended programmes must be submitted and approved before students can be registered on the programme and it can be delivered.
See programme approval forms (taught programmes)
Timelines and deadlines
The approval process timescales below are an indicative guide only. All new programmes require executive approval before they can be developed for full academic approval. For specific advice and guidance about your school¡¯s proposed new programme or amendment, please talk to your faculty?portfolio manager?as early as possible.
It is sometimes possible to fast-track an urgent programme proposal, but be aware that late proposals may not be accepted. Fast-tracked proposals receive the same level of scrutiny as any other proposal, from both executive and academic structures.??
New undergraduate programme

Initial discussion: should normally take place at faculty Portfolio Group meetings
Executive approval followed by full academic approval: completed and finalised at least 20 months before the programme commences?
Deadline for inclusion within CourseFinder: at least 18 months before the programme commences?
Quality Check: at least 6 months before the programme commences.

New taught postgraduate programme

Initial discussion: should normally take place at faculty Portfolio Group meetings???
Executive approval followed by full academic approval:?completed and finalised 15 months before the programme commences
Deadline for inclusion within CourseFinder: at least 12 months before the programme commences?
Quality Check: at least 6 months before the programme commences.

New Distance Learning Provision

If you are proposing distance learning provision, there are additional points to consider and you will need to discuss your proposal with the University Digital Education Service. Please also refer to the University Distance Learning Policy?for more information.

New Continuing Professional Development Provision

The approval process for continuing professional development depends on whether or not the provision carries credit.
See continuing professional development?(CPD)

Major Amendments

As for new programmes (see above)

Minor Module/Programme amendments

31 March in the session immediately preceding the session to which the changes apply.

Changes to programme entry requirements, or any other change affecting the recruitment cycle

For undergraduate programmes January, 20 months before entry.
For postgraduate programmes?15 months before entry.

Withdrawal of a programme

Before the application cycle for that year has begun (usually January,?20 months before entry for UG programmes and 15 months before entry for PG programmes).??

Initial proposal discussions
Discuss initial plans for new programmes at faculty Portfolio Group meetings.
The Faculty Executive Committee (or equivalent) should have the opportunity for strategic consideration and input into the proposal at an early stage. Faculty executive approval of the programme proposal is required before it can be developed for full academic approval. You should also consult with your Faculty Head of Marketing and Faculty Finance Manager about the programme at an early stage.
The programme approval process has two stages:
Executive programme approval

Stage 1 - executive approval. Robust up-front executive approval of a new programme?is based on a strategic, marketing, financial and operational analysis of the proposal.?The School completes Part A of the programme approval?form, which requires the signature of?the?Faculty Dean, confirming that the Faculty Executive Committee supports development of the programme for full?academic approval.???

Full academic programme approval

Stage?2 -?full academic programme approval. The primary quality approval process which involves the school?completing Part B of the programme approval form. This sets out the programme?specification, learning outcomes and assessment map in detail. The STSEC?endorses the proposal and it is then considered?for full academic approval by the PAG. An External Review of the programme is required as part of this process.??

Read New programme approval.
Quality Check
A Quality Check is undertaken at least 6 months before the programme commences (normally by the appropriate PAG).? At the Quality Check any new constituent module proposals are considered for approval, programme management arrangements are agreed, and the original programme documentation is reviewed to ensure that any issues have been addressed and all elements of the programme are fully aligned and deliverable.?
Read Quality Check.
Until a programme has been approved, students cannot be registered on it and boards of examiners cannot confer the programme award(s). This also applies to intermediate and ""fallback"" awards and variants.
Programme amendment
Programme amendments must be formally approved. This includes changes to the list of modules in the programme, or the programme requirements (eg making a module compulsory instead of optional).
You will need to take different actions, depending whether the amendments are major or minor ¨C see below.
Read Programme amendment processes.
Ad hoc and ad personam programme variation
In exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to make a time-limited amendment to a programme of study. This is known as a programme variation.

This is an ad personam programme variation where the exceptional circumstances relate to one student or a small number of individual students.
This is an ad hoc programme variation where the exceptional circumstances relate to an entire cohort of students.

Any ad personam or ad hoc programme variation must be approved by the relevant Pro-Dean for Student Education, acting on behalf of the Faculty Taught Student Education Committee (FTSEC).
Read Ad personam and ad hoc programme variation processes.
Withdrawal of a programme
Withdrawal or suspension of an existing programme of study for one or more sessions must be approved by the Portfolio Steering Group, acting on behalf of Taught Student Education Board and Senate.
The school seeks permission from the relevant Pro Dean for Student Education/Programme Approval Group (PAG) and then the?PSG ratifies the decision. Use the programme withdrawal form. There is a separate form to complete?when withdrawing?collaborative provision owing to the legal governance of collaborative arrangements.
Read Taught programme withdrawal?or collaborative provision withdrawal. ?
"
New Programme Approval,"Approval of a new programme is proposed by the School Taught Student Education Committee, approved by the Programme Approval Group and ratified by the Portfolio Steering Group.
The steps you need to take to fully approval a new programme are outlined below.
Step 1?- executive approval
complete part a of the programme proposal form
Download and complete the 'executive approval' programme proposal form, part a?(available at programme approval forms (taught programmes)). Full guidance?notes are provided within the proposal form.?
When complete the proposal should be submitted for consideration/approval at a Faculty Executive Group meeting. Once executive approval is granted the programme can then be developed for full academic approval.
Step?2 ¨C full academic approval
complete part b of the programme proposal form
Following executive approval, the relevant part b 'full academic approval' form can be downloaded and completed. There are different versions of the part b form available depending on the level of study and mode of delivery?(see programme approval forms (taught programmes)). Full guidance?notes are provided within each proposal form.?
Module proposal forms for any new module on the programme are not required at this stage, but they will inform the Quality Check.?They can be developed after executive approval is granted?and the programme framework is known.??
Step?3 ¨C obtain external review?
All proposals for new programmes or major programme amendments (see definition) need to be reviewed by an independent discipline expert. The proposing school or faculty arranges this. The report from the independent review forms part of the proposal. External reviewers should normally:

be currently employed in higher education at the rank of Professor, Reader or Senior Lecturer
be from within the European Economic Area
have significant teaching experience in higher education within the UK
not currently be, or have been in the past five years, a student, member of staff, or?external examiner of the University of Leeds.

Any exceptions to these criteria should be agreed in advance with the faculty Pro-Dean for Student Education.
External reviewers are paid a fee of ¡ê200 by the proposing school/faculty on submission of their report. Payments are subject to UK national insurance and income tax. Use the External review of a programme form.
Step?3 ¨C STSEC consideration
Submit for STSEC consideration:

the complete programme?proposal form (parts a and b - executive approval and full academic approval), which sets out the programme framework and specification
an external review and an appropriate response to this
an assessment map for the programme?(for proposals put forward in the?2019/20 session and beyond)?

School and STSEC responsibilities
For each award (including separately, for each fallback/intermediate award and any proposed variants) the proposing school is responsible for ensuring that:

Learning outcomes are specific, meaningful, achievable, relevant to the programme subject matter, at the appropriate level for each award and clearly differentiated between all intermediate/fallback awards and variants.
The programme is supported by the research strengths of the school and the curriculum is informed by recent scholarship and research.
For UG provision, the programme meets the minimum requirements for the Leeds Curriculum.
All of the documentation comprising the programme proposal is complete, including the full module proposals for any associated new modules (these can be approved at the Quality Check or earlier at programme approval stage).
For a new programme (or major programme amendment), an external review is obtained and the proposal includes an appropriate response to the review.
For an amended programme, a written explanation and rationale for the change is provided.
Consultation takes place with schools/departments whose modules form part of the programme¡¯s core or optional elements, or where there is significant disciplinary overlap (especially in relation to programme/module titles).
A named programme leader is identified.
The proposal is endorsed by the Head of School.
For proposals involving another school or faculty, it is endorsed by the Head of School and Faculty Dean.
The proposal is explicitly endorsed by STSEC (ie STSEC minutes separately list each proposed/amended award/fallback/variant).
All fields in the catalogue are complete within 5 working days following approval?and include final details of the proposals (data must be meaningful and accurate, free from spelling or grammatical errors, and appropriate for a student audience).

What school and STSEC endorsement means
Endorsement of the new programme proposal confirms the school and STSEC¡¯s agreement that:

the requirements above have been met
the proposal is academically sound and administratively complete

even if the check on requirements was delegated to sub-groups and/or professional staff.
Step?4 ¨C Programme Approval Group (PAG) consideration
Once executive approval is received and the STSEC has endorsed the proposal for full academic approval,? submit the following documentation electronically?to the Quality Assurance Team (QAT)?faculty contact, who will arrange?for PAG consideration:

the programme proposal form?(parts a and b - executive approval and full academic approval)?
an external review and an appropriate response to this
if available, any new module proposals for the new programme?
the STSEC minutes which endorse the proposal
a completed PAG coversheet, providing a brief rationale for the proposal

The programme/module structure is considered fixed once the programme is approved and it will be included in the University prospectus and coursefinder.
Once approved by the PAG the following programme elements cannot be changed:


the award, title and programme duration;


the level and credit weighting of compulsory and optional modules;


indicative programme learning outcomes;


indicative learning and teaching.?


PAG responsibilities
For each award (including separately, for each fallback/intermediate award and any proposed variants) the PAG will ensure that:

The programme fits with the faculty¡¯s strategic interests and academic vision.
The programme has been discussed and recommended for approval by the relevant STSEC.
The programme proposal is complete and includes appropriate?endorsement from the Head of School and Faculty Dean, and the equivalent for programmes involving another school or faculty.
An external review and appropriate school response are supplied.
The learning outcomes are at the appropriate level for each award and in proportion with those for other awards at the level within related disciplines.
The programme structure is coherent and will allow the learning outcomes to be met.
For UG proposals, the programme meets the requirements of the Leeds Curriculum.
The assessment map for the programme meets requirements for the Leeds Expectations for Assessment and Feedback (LEAF).

Step 5 ¨C Compile module proposal form(s) for STSEC endorsement
If not already included under step 4, the school can now develop any new constituent module proposals for endorsement by their STSEC.
Complete module proposal form, using the accompanying guidance for proposing a new module.
STSECs should consider and endorse the new module proposal(s) and consider these alongside the original programme proposal, ensuring that any outstanding issues have been addressed so that the programme presents a coherent package for the Quality Check.
Step 6 ¨C Quality Check
Once STSEC has endorsed the new constituent module proposal(s) and ensured that all elements of the programme documentation are complete and deliverable, send the following to your QA faculty contact:

the new module proposal(s);?
the finalised programme proposal form (if any changes have been made since the PAG, which should be highlighted);
an update on any issues raised at the PAG.

The QA faculty contact will arrange a Quality Check for the programme, which is normally undertaken by the appropriate PAG.? At the Quality Check the new modules will be considered for approval, programme management arrangements will be agreed and the original programme documentation will be reviewed to ensure that any issues have been addressed and the programme is fully aligned and deliverable.?
Read Quality Check, which includes the Quality Checklist that will be applied to all new programme proposals.
Step 7 ¨C Following PAG approval/Quality Check?
Following approval, schools must ensure that the finalised programme and module information is entered onto the catalogue, within 5 working days. All fields in the catalogue report must be correctly completed (with meaningful and accurate data, free from spelling or grammatical errors, and appropriate for a student audience).
Guidance information to help you enter proposal information (eg about data fields) is within the catalogue system. It is important you enter the proposal information directly into the catalogue because it links with other systems (such as the web catalogue, coursefinder, admissions systems and Banner). The catalogue has inbuilt checks and ""help"" text to make sure it gets the data needed for these systems.
Once the catalogue entry is complete the programme will be ""made live"" for application and registration within Banner. At the same time, the Portfolio Steering group ratifies the programme approval.
Programme approval process ¨C helpful points

The programme title supplied will be the exact wording which appears on the award certificate.
Where an award is available in part-time mode you should specify the sequence in which modules must be taken on the module listing.
Where a variant award is offered the certificate will carry the relevant wording, eg BA British Tourism (Industry). Variant awards will be ¡®(Industry)¡¯ ¡®(International)¡¯ or'(Enterprise)'; other variants are not permitted. Variant awards must be specified separately to the main award.
Where the school wishes to offer an ordinary variant of an undergraduate programme, this must be specified as a variant separately to the related honours award.
The programme leader must be a permanent member of University staff on a contract which involves teaching responsibilities.
Where a programme (or part of a programme) can be taken by distance learning, information on how it will operate in practice and the specific support arrangements need to be included in the general statement and/or in the section on distinctiveness. Schools need to consult with the University?Digital Learning Team on any such developments at an early stage
A proposing school must consult other schools whose modules form part of the programme¡¯s core or optional elements, to ensure that the additional numbers can be accommodated and that the module will continue to be offered in its current format.
Schools proposing a new programme title which might be linked to another discipline must consult the school concerned. Unresolved programme title issues will be forwarded to the Taught Portfolio Steering Group for resolution.
Where a collaborative programme involves an external institution partner in the programme delivery, there are additional requirements.?Schools must not enter into an agreement of any nature for delivery of a programme with another institution or organisation. Any such legal agreements will be organised through the procedures for collaborative provision and signed by the University Secretary.
Where the new programme will be overseen by an existing external examiner, please check that the additional workload is acceptable within the University procedures relating to external examiners, and get agreement with the examiner.
For subject benchmark statements, it is not expected that a programme will comply with all the specifications of a subject benchmark. However, the proposing school needs to evidence its consideration against the relevant benchmark(s) and include justification of omissions/additions.
The Head of School/Dean endorsement(s) on the proposal form confirm that the programme will further the school's academic development and that adequate school resources are available to deliver it. If additional resources are required these must be highlighted in the general statement.
For programmes delivered with another school/faculty, the signature of the Head of School/Dean from which the school is collaborating confirms their endorsement of the programme and contribution to its delivery.

?
"
Quality Check,"A Quality Check for each new programme is undertaken at least 6 months before it commences, to ensure that all elements of the programme are complete and deliverable.
The Quality Check for a new programme is normally completed by the appropriate Programme Approval Group (PAG) when it considers any new constituent modules on the programme. The Check involves consideration of the original programme proposal and all the modules contributing to the programme.? It provides the opportunity to discuss the management of the programme and operational considerations, particularly arrangements for more ¡®complex¡¯ programmes involving collaborative provision, study abroad or placement arrangements.

Taught programme amendment processes,"There are different amendment processes depending on the scale of the change proposed. Major programme amendments are approved by the Programme Approval Group. Minor programme amendments are approved by the School Taught Student Education Committee and reported to the Faculty Taught Student Education Committee.?
Different types of programme amendment are described below.
Please speak to your Quality Assurance team (QAT) faculty contact at an early stage regarding programme amendments and implementation timescales.?
Major amendments 
Major Programme Amendments are those that involve changes to the structure of a?programme which have the potential to impact on the programme level learning outcomes?and the programme title, i.e:

Any changes to the structure of the programme via the removal and/or addition of?compulsory modules. (Replacement compulsory modules, where these do not impact on programme level Learning Outcomes are not included) 
The withdrawal, addition or re-designation of optional modules as co-requisites or prerequisites?(where such changes impact on a substantial number of optional modules -?equating to 30% or more of the credit weighting for any single year of study, for example?40 credits at undergraduate or 60 credits at postgraduate level) 
Changes to the programme title and/or award, where this reflects changes to?programme content 
Significant changes to the mode of delivery (e.g., via introduction of a Flexible and?Distributed Learning mode or an alternative programme delivery location). 

See the definition of a?major programme amendment. 
Major programme amendments must go through the same approval process as for a new programme. All major programme amendments require an external review. The amendments are proposed by the School Taught Student Education Committee (STSEC), approved by the Programme Approval Group (PAG) and ratified by the Taught Student Education Board (TSEB). The PAG also has the responsibility for the approval of all new modules.
Proposing a major amendment
STSEC consideration
The proposal for STSEC must comprise of the following:? 

a rationale for the amendments 
the amended programme specification (either as a catalogue report or amended programme proposal form - see QA forms for the appropriate documentation) 
any new or amended modules that form part of the revised programme proposal 
an external review and appropriate response 

STSEC minutes must clearly document consideration of the amended programme proposal and the agreed outcomes.?
When preparing an amendment proposal, consider if the changes impact on progression/award requirements, or affect any collaboration or accreditation conditions. Also ensure that you consult other Schools on the proposals where necessary (especially for Joint Honours programmes).????
PAG consideration
Following STSEC endorsement, any changes STSEC agreed must be made to the proposal.? then submit electronically to your Quality Assurance team (QAT) contact the following, for onward consideration at the PAG:

the STSEC proposals, updated as appropriate (rationale for amendments, amended programme specification, any new or amended constituent modules, external review and response); 
a completed PAG coversheet, briefly explaining the items proposed; and 
minutes from the STSEC meeting confirming STSEC consideration and endorsement of the amendment. 

Following PAG approval, the School must ensure that the catalogue is fully updated to reflect the amended programme (and any module changes) as agreed by the PAG.?
Where successive or multiple major amendments lead to a substantial programme changes, a new Banner programme code is required.? This will ensure that the appropriate transcript information is held in the historical student record.?? 
Minor amendments
Minor amendments to programmes are all changes not covered in major amendments, above.? Examples include:

Change to a programme title (when the change is for marketing purposes and does not reflect any changes to the programme content, structure or learning outcomes. In these instances the advice of the Faculty's Marketing Manager should be sought and the title change agreed with the Dean of the relevant Faculty). 
Adding or removing optional modules (when these amount to less than 30% of the credit weighting for any one year). 
Module amendments, including changes to a module's learning outcomes, method of assessment or title (plus any?module title change?requires?a new module code?to be assigned). 

Minor amendments to programmes should be considered and approved by the STSEC and reported to FTSEC, using the report of STSEC business. 
Proposing a minor amendment
STSEC consideration
The proposal for STSEC must comprise of the following: 

a rationale for the amendments 
the amended programme specification (normally a catalogue report) 

STSEC minutes must clearly document consideration of the amended programme proposal and the agreed outcomes. 
Reporting to FTSEC
Following STSEC approval, the School must ensure that the catalogue is fully updated to reflect the amended programme (and any related module changes) as agreed by STSEC.?
The School must provide a report of STSEC Business?for FTSEC,?which will include a brief description of?amendment. The supporting STSEC minutes which document consideration of the proposal also need providing. (The programme amendment paperwork is not required by FTSEC but appropriate records need to be kept by the School.) ? and implications of the proposal. 
The deadline for approval of minor programme amendments is 31 March (six months before they take effect).?
Programme title changes
Programme title changes are considered major if they reflect changes to the programme content/learning outcomes. Title changes are considered minor if they are for marketing purposes only, in such instances seek advice from your Quality Assurance team (QAT) faculty contact and faculty marketing manager.
Note that changes of programme title can impact on visas and Certificates of Acceptance of Studies and thus international recruitment. Please seek advice from Taught Student Admissions. New programme titles should be approved before the recruitment cycle for the programme begins (by 28 February, 19 months before entry).
Changes to entry requirements
Entry requirements are usually agreed on an annual basis as part of each school¡¯s admissions policy.
Changes to entry requirements should be discussed with the faculty marketing manager and agreed with the Head of School before they are submitted for approval. Changes are then proposed by the STSEC, approved by the?PAG?and ratified by TSEB. They cannot be implemented until TSEB has granted approval. 
The deadline for changes to entry requirements is March, a year in advance (ie 18 months before entry). Changes after this time may be refused. This is earlier than the deadline for curriculum changes because any publicity material (eg prospectus and coursefinder) must be accurate for when students can first research their options before applying. 
Typographical corrections
Typographical corrections are changes which affect the layout, expression, spelling and/or grammar of text fields, but which do not change the meaning of the text. Examples include correcting spelling, punctuation or grammar, paragraph layout or bullet points. Typographical corrections do not include any addition/removal of content. Typographical corrections can be made without committee approval provided that the reasons for change are formally recorded. The catalogue retains a record of versions and usernames where changes are made.
Open fields
Open fields impact the operational delivery of modules but do not affect the nature of study or the student achievement. Changes to information in these fields do not require academic committee approval but are usually subject to management approval within the parent school. 
The open fields for programme entries are:

staff 
coursefinder fields (Note: entry requirements are not open, only text descriptions of the programme for coursefinder) 
fields on the HESA tab. 

The open fields for module entries are:

staff 
JACS code(s) 
teaching periods, including part of term (semester) and caps on enrolment numbers, providing that the changes do not significantly change the structure of approved programmes. 
"
Taught programme withdrawal,"To withdraw or temporarily suspend a programme, a school must seek approval from the Portfolio Steering Group,?via the relevant Programme Approval Group (PAG). Additional requirements for withdrawal apply if the programme is taught in collaboration.
The Portfolio Steering Group?ratifies taught programme withdrawal , acting on behalf of Senate and PAG approval follows recommendation from the School Taught Student Education Committee (STSEC). Schools must use the programme withdrawal form to request approval. Depending on the timing, it may also be necessary to seek permission from the Deputy Vice Chancellor for Student Education (for example, if withdrawal/suspension is considered within an application cycle).
The programme withdrawal form?must be completed to?request approval. Consultation with other teaching schools/departments or external institutions contributing to the programme is required. ?
Careful consideration should be given to the status of existing literature/information about the programme (for example, the prospectus and other print materials as well as Coursefinder and the programme catalogue) and the timing of application and recruitment cycles, open day presentations and the existence of any deferred applications/offers. Partnerships or collaborative agreements with other institutions or organisations require particular attention. Early consultation with the Faculty Marketing Manager is important.
Withdrawing a taught programme from marketing and recruitment

If the proposal to withdraw precedes the start of the recruitment cycle for the next entry point and receipt of any applications, schools should complete the programme withdrawal form and seek approval from the Pro Dean for Student Education (DVC approval is not required in this situation). The start of the recruitment cycle is normally defined by the Coursefinder rollover point (for example, around March 2019 for both UG and TP entry in September 2021; though different cycles may apply for specific courses). If the proposal is straightforward and does not involve any co-teaching or collaborative partners, the school may proceed and request approval.
In exceptional circumstances, if the proposal to withdraw comes after initial release of advertising/Coursefinder rollover, but before receipt of any applications, further to consultation with Faculty Marketing and Admissions, schools may proceed as above with the proposal to withdraw and an associated communications plan presented to the PAG/Pro Dean for Student Education for consideration.
In exceptional circumstances, if the proposal to withdraw comes after receipt of applications or offers (including any deferred from previous application cycles), permission must be sought from the Deputy Vice Chancellor for Student Education and the specific approach to communications and further action must be agreed with Faculty Marking and Admissions (and detailed on the withdrawal form). Ideally, suitable alternative arrangements will be presented to any offer holders/applicants. Offering a place on a programme of study represents a contract between the University and the student in which the University sets out its obligation to provide the programme as advertised unless very exceptional circumstances outside the institution's control ensue (further details about such rare exceptions are set out in the student contract and, where appropriate, in advertising such as the prospectus).

Consultation
The views of co-teaching schools/faculties involved in programme delivery (for example, contributing compulsory or optional modules) must be sought and properly considered. Particular attention is necessary if any external partners are involved; where withdrawal or suspension involves collaborative partners, the decision to withdraw must be agreed by all interested parties and must take account of any relevant provisions in the legal agreement in force at the time.
Teaching out programmes
Programmes withdrawn from marketing and recruitment activity may still have students registered on them, and the University¡¯s commitment to their on-course experience continues so that the University¡¯s obligations to individuals are reasonably and fairly fulfilled. The duration of the teaching-out period will include any study abroad or placement activity, the usual re-examination opportunities, and should accommodate students with temporary suspension from study. Communication with students on teach-out programmes is important to provide them with reassurance about the continuing coherence of their study, and consideration may need to be given to final cohorts¡¯ continuing relationship with the relevant academic community (for example, students on related programmes, and any new programmes being introduced). This guidance does not permit the immediate withdrawal of programmes on which students are registered, as this would be contrary to the University's commitment to teach out.
Programme suspension
In the case of a programme being suspended, the same protocols for removal from marketing and recruitment apply as for programme withdrawal. In addition, the conditions for reinstatement should be set out at the point of suspension. These terms are likely to be case-specific (for instance due to funder demand, resource or space contexts, for example) but academic, resourcing and financial/strategic cases must be assured explicitly at the point reinstatement is considered for approval.
A proposal for the temporary suspension of a programme should be accompanied by a rationale for the suspension and reinstatement conditions. The relevant Programme Approval Group will consider and approve the case for reinstatement at such time that arises. Programme Approval Groups will also review the ongoing status/viability of any programme suspended for two successive years.?
In the case of a programme being suspended, the same protocols for removal from marketing and recruitment apply as for programme withdrawal. In addition, the conditions for reinstatement should be set out at the point of suspension. These terms are likely to be case-specific (for instance due to funder demand, resource or space contexts, for example) but academic, resourcing and financial/strategic cases must be assured explicitly at the point reinstatement is considered for approval.

See collaborative programme withdrawal?for further details.
"
Collaborative programme approval,"Collaborative programmes have extra approval and review requirements, which will vary according to the type of arrangement being proposed and whether it is?taught or research.
Collaborative provision involves the University working with an external partner, under the governance of a signed legal agreement, to offer educational opportunities for the award of credit. These arrangements are more complex in their?structure than internal provision, and therefore follow different approval and review processes.? To gain approval, a collaborative programme must align with the University's strategic aims.
The University's?International?Office and Quality Assurance Team are responsible for facilitating the approval and review processes for collaborative arrangements, and should be contacted at the outset of the development of the proposal.
Taught programmes
For taught programmes, collaborative provision is a systematic collaborative arrangement for course provision with an external partner under which a student can gain:

entry to
advanced standing on, or
credit for

a taught programme or award of the University of Leeds.??
Research programmes
Please contact the Doctoral College for further guidance on the development and approval of collaborative research arrangements.
Guidance
Read full details of the planning, development and approval of new collaborative arrangements in the Collaborative provision guidance (PDF).
Taught arrangement types and approval forms
The different categories of collaborative arrangements?permissible within the University's Collaborative Provision framework require completion of different approval forms.? See collaborative provision approval forms?(PDF) which specifies the?different arrangement types for individual approval forms,?which should be completed in accordance with the collaborative provision guidance (PDF) document.? (Please note that Stage 2: Off-Campus Delivery and Advanced Arrangement Form will be circulated to proposers once the Stage 1: Outline Approval Form is fully completed.)
University Register of Collaborative Provision
The University maintains an internal record of partnerships taught in collaboration. Please contact the Quality Assurance Team or International Office for details.

Higher and degree apprenticeship approval,"The University is committed to developing a portfolio of Higher and Degree Apprenticeship programmes which respond to employer demand in areas of mutual benefit
Degree Apprenticeship Outline Business Case?
To avoid unnecessary work in developing new or amended programme documentation, a Degree Apprenticeship Outline Business Case (DAOBC) is required to identify the benefits and costs of the programme. The Degree Apprenticeship Outline Business Case pro-forma contains guidance notes for each section beginning on page 6. Before completing the pro-forma, please ensure the programme has the support of your Faculty Pro-Dean for Student Education.
The financial viability section of the pro-forma should be completed in consultation with the Faculty Finance Officer. A financial spreadsheet version of the form should be utilised.
In some cases the needs of the employer as set out in the degree apprenticeship standard will best be met through cross-faculty academic provision, in which case the DAOBC will require consultation with, and support from, both Faculties.
The DAOBC will be considered by a designated group of University Executive Group (UEG) members which will be responsible for institutional approval of the outline business case for the development of all higher and degree apprenticeship programmes. If the outline business case is accepted, the Faculty will take responsibility for the approval of the programme, focussing on the academic content, design, quality and standards.
Information and advice
If you are considering developing a?higher or degree apprenticeship programme, please speak to a member of the?Learning Enhancement Team in the first instance.??
The Learning Enhancement Team offers advice and guidance on the University¡¯s approach to higher and degree apprenticeships. The LE Team will also outline how Ofsted inspects the quality of apprenticeship training that is delivered by the University of Leeds as a training provider, to ensure it is high-quality and meets the needs of employers and apprentices.

Joint honours programme approval,"Joint honours programmes have extra approval requirements, involving liaison between the two teaching schools. Approval processes for new programme proposal, programme withdrawal and for programme and module changes are explained here.
A joint honours programme is a particular kind of interdisciplinary programme where students combine two different subjects in approximately equal proportions.
Full details are in the Joint honours programme approval guidance.
Programme amendment responsibilities
Schools have overall academic responsibility for all programmes they parent. For joint honours programmes, this includes responsibility for the co-taught disciplines through liaison with partner schools. Review and development of the curriculum may be instigated by either teaching school, but amendments to programmes (including changes to the module provision in either discipline) will be the responsibility of the parent school.
Programme teams and the co-teaching schools
The programme team is central to the process of reviewing and updating programmes. At the core of the programme team are the programme leader in the parent school and the link tutor in the co-teaching school. Directors of Student Education must ensure that programme leaders and link tutors are included in any discussions in their schools about changes in provision that may impact on the structure or content of joint honours teaching.
Co-teaching School Taught Student Education Committees (STSECs) should keep parent STSECs informed, at an early stage, of proposed changes to their provision which will impact on joint honours programmes.
Programme teams and especially link tutors need to be aware at all times of:

the approval timetable and committee deadlines within the parent school(s)/faculty(ies)
any impact on marketing materials, which are produced well in advance.

Module amendments
Amendments within a module which are not substantial enough to require a new module proposal /?code will be approved by the teaching school and do not need to be formally reported to joint honours partners.
Any change which is substantial enough to require a new module code will need to follow the process below. Read more in Module approval.
Note that withdrawing compulsory/optional modules and/or proposing new compulsory/optional modules within either discipline counts as a programme amendment, even where the overall structure of the programme remains the same. Read more about major programme amendments and minor programme amendments in Taught programme amendment.
In practice, approval of amendments will happen in parallel: the teaching STSEC approves (and the FTSEC notes) the module provision within each discipline, while?the parenting STSEC approves?(and the FTSEC notes)?associated amendments to the programmes they parent, while considering the balance between disciplines, interdisciplinary elements and skills training.
Review and development of the provision in a co-teaching school may result in recommendations to amend a number of different joint honours programmes, which may be parented in different schools/faculties.
Schools may wish to co-opt relevant members of partner schools to their Taught Student Education Committees (TSECs) to help communication.
Approval in the parent school/faculty
Formal approval of programme amendments will be through the parent STSEC and either the Programme Approval Group (for major programme amendments)?or FTSEC (for reporting minor programme amendments). Catalogue records and workflow will be owned and managed by the parent school.
The parent?STSECs will assure themselves that co-teaching partners have been consulted before recommending approval to the PAG or reporting the change to FTSEC. The catalogue software includes fields where this consultation can be noted. The level of consultation should be appropriate to the scale of the proposed amendment. For example, for a comprehensive review of the structure of a programme, the parent STSEC may wish to see notes from a programme team meeting where both disciplines have been represented, alongside endorsement of the Director of Student Education in the co-teaching school. For a minor change to the availability of different optional modules, a record that co-teaching partners have been informed would suffice.
Withdrawal of joint honours programmes
Withdrawal of a joint honours programme should follow the same process as for amendments. The withdrawal form includes space to note partners who have been consulted before a recommendation to withdraw a programme is made.? See programme withdrawal form.
Parent STSECs and PAGs?must assure themselves that co-teaching partners have been consulted before recommending withdrawal. The recommendation to withdraw should be approved by STSEC and the relevant Pro Dean for Student Education and the parent school/faculty executive, and then reported to the co-teaching STSEC and FTSEC.
Proposing a new joint honours programme
A proposal for a new joint honours programme will be approved by the proposed parent school/faculty, who will satisfy themselves that partner schools fully support the proposal before recommending approval.
"
Study abroad approval,"Quality assurance of study abroad arrangements, including new exchanges, are supported by the Study Abroad office and overseen by the Collaborations and Partnerships Committee via the Study Abroad Programme Approval Group.
Module specification and approval
Periods of study abroad which are part of the programme of study should be specified as a module(s) in the usual way. Details?of the learning and teaching and the assessment are considered for approval by the Study Abroad?Programme Approval Group and then entered onto the module catalogue.
Exchange agreements
When a school wishes to enter into a new arrangement with an institution and implement a student exchange agreement, the details of the proposal must be considered by the School Taught Student Education Committee and the Study Abroad Programme Approval Group. If the institution is not an existing study abroad partner, a Partner Report is also required. ?More information and approval forms are available in the Study abroad section?and below (see?'how to set up a new exchange').
How to set up a new exchange
If you would like to set up a new exchange for study abroad, please contact the Study Abroad Office (SAO) before completing any documentation. The SAO can give you advice and guidance on what information you will need and discuss the general suitability of the proposed partner. This includes consideration about whether the link is likely to be reciprocal, as agreements must balance student numbers given the tuition fee is waived.
For further information, please contact?Ben Oldham, Study Abroad Manager.
New study abroad agreement
Follow the process outlined below:


Proposer to?discuss the new agreement?with SAO and check if the institution is an existing study abroad partner. A Partner Report must be completed before a new study abroad partner can be approved: The proposed partner can complete the Partner Report,?however it should be checked and if necessary added to by the proposing school. A site visit is recommended before a new agreement is created, although this is at the discretion of the proposing school. If the institution is an existing partner, a new Partner Report is not necessary.


Proposer?to complete a proposal for a new study abroad agreement.


Send a copy of the form(s)?to both the School Taught Student Education Committee (STSEC) and the Study Abroad office.


School TSEC considers the proposal for endorsement and then sends it to the Quality Assurance team.


The signed documentation is then presented to the Study Abroad Programme Approval Group (SAPAG) which reviews and approves the proposal. The Quality Assurance team manages this stage of the process.


If you are considering language preparation content for a new proposal then please refer to the Language Attainment Guidelines.

Placements approval,"Work placement learning that is part of a programme of study must be approved and regularly reviewed through the University's usual quality assurance arrangements.
?
This includes the detailed specification of:

learning outcomes
teaching and learning
assessment methods.

Placement modules, like all other modules, are subject to student evaluation (through student evaluation surveys) and staff review.
?
Each placement must also be approved by the relevant school or faculty according to published academic, and health and safety, criteria.

Continuing professional development,"Approval processes for continuing professional development.
Continuing professional development (CPD) in the University describes short or long training programmes, which:

develop employment-related knowledge, skills and understanding, and/or
are aimed mainly at developing or updating the skills of people already in employment, or in the labour market but not actually employed.

The CPD may, or may not, carry credits. This is known as credit-bearing or non-credit-bearing CPD and will affect the assurance process you need to follow.
CPD provision is an integral element of a school¡¯s taught provision portfolio. Schools are responsible for maintaining a register of all their credit-bearing and non-credit bearing CPD courses and activities.
It is important that the University has an accurate?CPD record for reporting to?the Higher Education Business and Community Interaction (HE-BCI) survey which collects financial and output data related to knowledge exchange.?
Pro forma for new?CPD?
For all new CPD modules, courses, programme and events aimed at industry and wider partners (not existing staff or students),?you will need to complete the?pro forma?for new CPD (Word) and?separate CPD?financial costings spreadsheet.
Once the pro forma and costings template are completed and signed, they should be sent to: professionaldevelopment@leeds.ac.uk
The pro forma?will then be considered at the next CPD Approval Group meeting, and (subject to approval) recorded accurately for the University's annual CPD return.?Acknowledging the fast pace required to meet the needs of businesses,?we will be responsive and can consider proposals electronically. ???
Non credit-bearing CPD
Non credit-bearing CPD courses include summer schools and other short courses for which no credit is awarded by the University.
Credit-bearing CPD
If the CPD carries credits, the University¡¯s normal quality assurance procedures for modules and programmes (including collaborative provision) apply. Completion of the CPD pro forma is an additional step required when modules or programmes are to be offered externally as CPD.
Additional points to consider
If you are considering offering online or blended learning CPD, please consult with the Digital Education Service or your Faculty Digital Education Academic Lead.
If you have any queries regarding the approval process for CPD, please send an email to: professionaldevelopment@leeds.ac.uk? and we will be happy to help and offer advice.?

Ad personam and ad hoc programme variation processes,"Ad personam or ad hoc programme variations must be approved by the relevant Pro-Dean for Student Education, acting on behalf of the Faculty Taught Student Education Committee.
The processes you need to go through to make ad personam and ad hoc programme variations are outlined here.
Making a case: programme learning outcomes
For both ad personam and ad hoc programme variation, the proposing school should set out how:

the proposed revised programme will be structured
the revised structure will allow the student(s) to meet the programme learning outcomes.

Note: It is particularly important that any waiver or change to compulsory modules is justified in relation to the programme learning outcomes.
Ad personam programmes for individual students
A school proposes an ad personam programme variation through the Exams team.
Use the Request for ad personam programme variation approval form. Email this to: examinationsconf@leeds.ac.uk.
The Exams team will seek approval from the relevant Pro-Dean for Student Education. If the request is approved, the Programmes and Assessment team will make the necessary changes directly in the student record within Banner.
Note: an ad personam programme is approved for the named student only. To use it for other students, you must get permission again from the Faculty Taught Student Education Committee (FTSEC).
Ad hoc changes to a programme
A school proposes an ad hoc programme variation through the Quality Assurance team (QAT).
?
Use Part B of the?apppropriate programme proposal form (undergraduate or?postgraduate) to provide details of the new ad hoc programme variation, see programme proposal forms. QAT will then seek approval from the relevant Pro-Dean/FTSEC.
When the changes have been approved, you need to make them in the programme catalogue entry, so they are implemented for all students in the cohort.
An ad hoc programme will be approved for a specified cohort of students only. To use it for subsequent cohorts, you must again get approval from the Pro-Dean/FTSEC.
Schools must:

Complete full documentation for the ad hoc programme, including specifying the rules for eligibility for awards where these differ from the normal arrangements.
Ensure that the proposed modules comprise a coherent and logical choice, consistent with the intended programme learning outcomes.
Check the acceptability of the arrangement with all participating schools and any external partners.
Clear any practical difficulties, such as normal pre-requisites, which might have to be set aside.
Discuss, where appropriate, the proposed ad hoc arrangements with the relevant external examiner(s) and keep a record of such discussions

"
Reduced time at Leeds for postgraduate researchers,"Postgraduate researchers may undertake a limited amount of research away from the University, either on approved fieldwork or in approved academic institutions or scientific, clinical or industrial locations.
This could apply to postgraduate researchers studying under Marie Curie ITN initiatives, Horizon 2020 or as part of industrial sponsorship. Split-site programmes are considered under a seperate process.
Schools should set out the planned arrangements and make a request to Doctoral College Operations?if it is anticipated that this?time away will exceed 12 months of the total period of study. Transfer and examination must?take place at the University of Leeds.?
The following information should be included:
?

Details of the programme, including any partners involved in the project
Reasons for why the PGR is not able to undertake this research at the University of Leeds?
The locations where the PGR will be studying
A proposed schedule of study, including a month-by-month breakdown of activity to undertaken and in which location
Details of any visits by the supervisor(s) to the proposed location
How the supervision team will continue regular supervision meetings during the PGR's time away from the University

This request will then be considered by the Chair of PGR Programmes and Quality Group. PGRs studying under a Student visa must declare any change of location to Doctoral College Operations ?

"
Collaborative provision amendments,"The process for making changes to collaborative arrangements will vary according to the category of the arrangement and the type of amendment proposed.
Decisions to make minor amendments to collaborative arrangements which do not change the nature of the collaboration can be approved via the School Taught Student Education Committee and actioned at any time during the term of the legal agreement. The proposal form to amend existing collaborative arrangements will need to be completed.?Examples of minor amendments to a collaborative arrangement would be similar to those employed for non-collaborative provision, and would in most cases not be specific to the arrangement and therefore approved under normal STSEC procedures (for example, module withdrawals).
Small scholarship adjustments, entry requirements and expected student numbers also constitute minor amendments, but should also be done in consultation with the International Office. Potential impacts in terms of recruitment and resources should be considered. Changes to the contract will be drafted and shared with the partner by the International Office.
Changes to an agreement which represent a new proposal (eg adding another programme) should go through the full collaborative programme approval process.
Where schools wish to extend a collaboration with an existing partner to include an additional agreement of a new type (eg the existing arrangement is an articulation but both parties wish to develop a joint degree), the proposal for the new model of collaboration would need to go through the full approval process for the relevant model.
Where the proposal is to extend the existing model of collaboration (eg an articulation) to include another school or faculty at Leeds, the proposal would need to go through the full collaborative programme approval process for the school/faculty joining the agreement.
Where partner universities operate across multiple campuses, there may be a wish to extend the agreement to include students from different locations studying the same programme. This does not represent a new agreement and is treated as an extension to the existing arrangement by adding new progression routes. This can be approved via STSEC as a minor amendment. Changes to the contract will be drafted and shared with the partner by the International Office.???
"
Taught Student Education Board,"Taught Student Education Board is responsible for providing strategic direction to the Student Education area.
Taught Student Education Board (TSEB) takes a holistic approach which combines quality assurance and quality enhancement. It also considers developments in all aspects of taught student support. The Board keeps a watching brief on national and international developments and coordinates the University's response to national consultations.

Programme approval groups,"These groups have responsibility for approving new programmes, new modules and major programme amendments.

Programme Approval Groups (PAGs) operate at faculty level, in parallel but convened separately to the Faculty Taught Student Education Committees (FTSECs).? They have responsibility for approving new programmes, new modules and major programme amendments which have been proposed by School Taught Student Education Committees (STSECs). Taught Student Education Board ratifies new programmes and major programme amendments approved by PAGs.
Operation

PAG meetings are held on a Faculty by Faculty basis (unless considering inter-Faculty collaborations, where specific cross-Faculty meetings will be convened). They are chaired by the relevant Faculty Pro Dean for Student Education.
Meetings are held three times within the academic session and in accordance with the FTSEC meeting schedule.? They are held in December, March and June but additional ad hoc meetings can be held if business requires.
The Faculty Quality Assurance FPM (under the line management of the FESM) has responsibility for the maintenance of a Faculty list of anticipated taught programme proposals, working collaboratively with the Quality Assurance Team and Directors of Student Education.
Schools need to send any PAG proposals (new programmes/modules or major programme amendments) which STSEC has endorsed to their Quality Assurance team (QAT) faculty contact for onward consideration at a PAG. Read more in Approval process overview.
Academic colleagues proposing programme developments are invited to present at the PAG meeting (where this is feasible, otherwise proposals are presented by the relevant Director of Student Education).
Following PAG approval, the Faculty Quality Assurance FPM, in collaboration with the QA Team and with central catalogue colleagues, is responsible for ensuring the catalogue entry is accurate.
The approval of business will be agreed by the Pro Dean for Student Education once any conditions attached to it have been appropriately addressed.? Approval of new programmes and major programme amendments are then reported to the Taught Student Education Board.?

PAG Papers
Documents, including PAG agendas and proposals are available on SharePoint (by Faculty). These can be accessed by any student or member of staff, but you will need to log on to the system with your University IT username and password.

For those using Explorance Blue, this can be done through the automated student report process.?Schools not using Explorance Blue should continue to communicate with their students following the normal process, and may opt to use either the former module review process or to complete an MS Word version of the student report. ?
For those schools that have chosen to continue to use the full Module Review form (to meet local or external requirements), the former?module review template can be found here.?
Student reports and/or module reviews will be considered by the STSEC (or appropriate sub-committee) and the outcome of any wider changes made should be reported to students through?Explorance Blue,?Student Staff Partnership Forum,?Minerva or the?module handbook. ?

"
Student education review - overview,"The Head of School (or nominee, usually the Director of Student Education) is responsible for ensuring that the processes of evaluation, review and reflection are undertaken, in line with university policy.
The outcomes of module review and programme review are considered at Annual School Review (Student Education) meetings.?
Purpose of academic review
The University's review processes are to ensure that its programmes of study are current and appropriately structured. The processes also give reassurance that the quality of the student learning experience is managed effectively across the University.
Programme and module review
The objectives of the programme and module review procedures are to:

monitor student experience at the module and programme level
maintain the currency and research focus of programmes
address concerns raised by students, external examiners, professional bodies
identify areas in need of enhancement
identify good practice worthy of wider dissemination
reduce unnecessary bureaucracy and make the process efficient in terms of staff time, so that they can concentrate on enhancement.

School procedures
School procedures will continue to be scrutinised as part of Student Academic Experience Review and, where significant weaknesses are identified, a process of comprehensive, formal, annual module and programme review may be required. Schools should therefore keep full documentation of their procedures for programme and module review.?
"
Module evaluation surveys,"Student evaluation of a module is an essential part of module review. There are minimum requirements for module evaluation surveys, including a set of core statements to which students must respond.
As a minimum, every module must be surveyed following its delivery. Mid-module evaluations, or ¡®snapshots¡¯ (see below), are also used to capture the full student experience and are encouraged as a mechanism for highlighting opportunities for enhancements during the course of module delivery.?
Process
Schools should follow these guidelines when running a module evaluation survey:

The standard set of required?¡®core statements¡¯ must be used - read Module evaluation survey statements
All core statements require a response based on a 5 point Likert scale?
Students should be allocated class time to complete the module evaluation as this has been shown to improve survey response rates.
In the 2021/22 session, schools can use either Explorance Blue Module Evaluations or an alternative system to collect and collate evaluations.
The collated results for a module should be reported to the staff teaching on the module and to the Director of Student Education (or equivalent in a unitary faculty).
The module team, chaired by the module leader, should be responsible for undertaking the detailed evaluation and for responding appropriately.

Mid-module snapshots
Schools?are encouraged to?put in place mechanisms to obtain mid-module snapshot evaluations, and particularly for:

all new modules
modules where the form of teaching has significantly changed
modules where action has been taken following an earlier unfavourable evaluation.??

For details on the option to carry out a ¡®mid-module snapshot¡¯?for ¡®long, thin¡¯ modules delivered over 2 semesters please contact TheLeedsPartnership@leeds.ac.uk.?Mid-module snapshot evaluations can also be easily carried out through MS Forms or short surveys in Minerva. You could also consider sampling students or focus groups.?
Reporting and follow-up
The module survey quantitative profiles should be presented in the same way as the NSS scores and be considered at the School Taught Student Education Committee and the Student Staff Partnership Forum.?


The results of the student evaluation for each module and any response to it should be made available to students.?Read more in Module review.
"
Module evaluation survey questions,"Module evaluation surveys at the University must include a set of questions or ¡®core statements¡¯ to which students are required to?respond as part of the survey.
Required ¡®core?statements¡¯
Due to hybrid delivery for the 2020/21 academic session, module evaluation questions have been updated to reflect the change in pedagogical approach. The set of 10 core statements, which module evaluation surveys must include in full, is:
1. Overall, I?was satisfied with the quality of the module
2. Teaching on the module was of a high standard
3. Learning resources were intellectually stimulating and supported my learning
4. The content of the module was informed by relevant research and /or practice
5. The introduction to the module adequately prepared and informed me of the requirements to successfully engage with the module
6. The module provided opportunities to interact with others and to share knowledge, ideas and perspectives
7. All learning tasks and in-course assessments supported my understanding of the module¡¯s content
8. There were opportunities to provide in-course feedback on the delivery of the module and the learning resources provided
9. Feedback on my work during the module helped me monitor my progress and understanding
10. The module was well managed and?organised
To support the dissemination and completion of this evaluation, the Enterprise Survey tool will be made available to all schools through Minerva to facilitate the capturing of this data across all modules.?
Additional?statements
The module evaluation should include the option for students to provide informative free text comments, including an opportunity?for schools to obtain feedback on specific topics.??
Scoring Methodology
?All core statements, outlined above, require a response based on a 5 point Likert scale with the following scoring system:

Programme review,"
Every year, programme reviews take place using feedback from students, colleagues and external sources together with student progression and award data to plan improvement.
The review process


The student learning experience is at the heart of the programme review process. The school should review all programmes of study each year to make sure they still allow students to achieve the specified learning outcomes.? The programme review form should be completed following c/¡¯onsideration of relevant module review forms, discussion with the Programme Team at the annual Programme Review Meeting and discussion with students at relevant Student Staff Partnership Forums.
Programme Leaders are also required to review and affirm, or propose changes to programme level learning outcomes taking into account the incremental impact of any programme and module amendments.?
Review tools


Undergraduate and postgraduate programmes
There is a programme review template?for both undergraduate and postgraduate taught programmes, which the Programme Leader needs?to complete. This includes a section on programme variants, which facilitates the review of any industrial variants or study abroad variants?(if applicable), For programmes taught in collaboration or subject to articulation arrangements, there is?also an?appendix to complete.?
Apprenticeship programmes
For apprenticeship programmes, there is a seperate apprenticeship programme review template?for the Programme Leader to complete.?
Requirements

The programme review requires?consideration of:

Student education?data, including assessment outcomes?
Student feedback
Programme (Team/Leader) reflection
Programme Identified Actions
External considerations
Off-the-job learning hours (for Apprenticeship programmes only)
Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Body?compliance (where relevant)


Reporting

Completed programme reviews will be discussed and approved?by the School Taught Student Education Committee and students informed through the Student Staff Partnership Forum and?Minerva or programme handbooks.?
Approved programme reviews should be uploaded to the School Education Review Teams channel.?
"
Collaborative provision review,"A collaborative provision arrangement is subject to a full review process within 6 months of its contract expiry date.
All arrangements that formally constitute collaborative provision are subject to a periodic review process. The Review is the principal means by which the University is assured of the efficacy and robustness of the collaborative arrangement in relation to the quality of its learning opportunities and academic standards. It is also the mechanism by which the renewal of the legal agreement governing the arrangement is approved.
The External Collaborative Review document provides further guidance on the review process off-campus, joint delivery and advanced collaborative arrangements. It does not cover arrangements that are characterised as low risk (progression arrangements) which do not formally constitute collaborative provision, as it is expected that these will be monitored via the school/faculty's existing rolling review processes (internal programme reviews and Annual School Reviews).
"
Annual School Review (Student Education),"An Annual School Review (Student Education) will be organised by the Quality Assurance team each year to review the school's progress and the subsequent report will form part of the annual planning round.
What is an Annual School Review (Student Education)?
An Annual School Review (Student Education) is carried out by each Faculty Taught Student Education Committee (FTSEC) for all its schools every year unless a Student Academic Experience Review (SAER) is scheduled for that academic session. It is a two-hour meeting within the school with representatives from FTSEC and the Student Education Service team.
Purpose
The Annual School Review (Student Education) exists to:

monitor each school's engagement with rolling review processes and compliance with University quality assurance and quality enhancement processes
provide a chance to discuss the school's engagement with key strategic enhancement priorities
give the senior team the chance to discuss taught student education, including the programme portfolio and the response to student feedback
provide an annual opportunity to think about risks and weaknesses and how to combat them in future
recognise good practice and what could be learned from this
generate information and data for the faculty integrated planning exercise (IPE) discussions

Arrangements
The meeting should:

be arranged and serviced by the Quality Assurance team
be chaired by the Pro-Dean for Student Education
include the Head of School, Director of Student Education, other senior school staff and representatives of both the student base and the faculty outside of the school
focus on accountability as well as improvement
include a thematic agenda as chosen each year by the Taught Student Education Board (see below)

Thematic elements
Every year the Taught Student Education Board (TSEB) chooses a thematic element to fit in with taught student education priorities for the session. This will be included in the agenda for all Annual School Reviews (Student Education).
Agenda?
All Annual School Review (Student Education) meetings will follow a common agenda, although there will be opportunity to discuss issues relevant to an individual school/faculty. The agenda is agreed annually in consultation with the Pro Deans for Student Education.
Documentation
The Quality Assurance team will provide all documentation for the?ASR, working in consultation with the School. Documentation is circulated one week in advance of the meeting.?
Reporting
After the meeting, the following should happen:?


follow up actions take place under the responsibility of the Head of School and Director of Student Education
a report of the annual school review is submitted to FTSEC and Faculty Executive Committee (FEC) who then become responsible for making sure resulting actions are followed through
the report forms part of the documentation for the annual planning round (IPE).


"
Review of Study Abroad/Horizon Year Partnerships,"The University has a process of regular review for institution-wide and School-based study abroad/Horizon year arrangements. 
The Standing Group on Study Abroad reviews institution-wide partners every six years. Agreements for existing School-based arrangements with overseas partners for exchange of undergraduate and postgraduate students are also the subject of review and renewal after a period of six years, in line with the cycle of School Academic Experience Reviews (SAER). See the University Guidance for the completion of review of Study Abroad/Horizon Year Partnerships. 
AIM OF THE REVIEW
Reviews of study abroad arrangements consider whether the exchange is balanced in terms of student numbers and continues to be in the strategic interest of the School and the University as a whole. 
PROCESS FOR SCHOOL PARTNERSHIPS
Review of existing School partnership arrangements are prompted by the Quality Assurance team (QAT) as part of the Student Academic Experience Review (SAER) process, based on a list of on-going partnerships provided by the Study Abroad Office. Reviews should be led by the School¡¯s Study Abroad Co-ordinator and by the Director of Student Education. A standard set of questions are used as a basis for the review. Any outcomes or issues arising from the reviews of study abroad should be picked up as part of the SAER. Recommendations to renew partnerships are considered by the Standing Group on Study Abroad. 
PROCESS FOR INSTITUTIONAL-WIDE PARTNERSHIPS 
Review of existing Institution-wide links are conducted by the Study Abroad Office on a rolling 6-year basis, in consultation with Schools and Faculties. Recommendations for renewal are made to the Standing Group on Study Abroad. The Standing Group on Study Abroad then considers the review information and formally recommends either continuation or withdrawal of the School or Institutional partnership to the Taught Student Education Board. "
Collaborative programme approval,"Collaborative programmes have extra approval and review requirements, which will vary according to the type of arrangement being proposed and whether it is?taught or research.
Collaborative provision involves the University working with an external partner, under the governance of a signed legal agreement, to offer educational opportunities for the award of credit. These arrangements are more complex in their?structure than internal provision, and therefore follow different approval and review processes.? To gain approval, a collaborative programme must align with the University's strategic aims.
The University's?International?Office and Quality Assurance Team are responsible for facilitating the approval and review processes for collaborative arrangements, and should be contacted at the outset of the development of the proposal.
Taught programmes
For taught programmes, collaborative provision is a systematic collaborative arrangement for course provision with an external partner under which a student can gain:

entry to
advanced standing on, or
credit for

a taught programme or award of the University of Leeds.??
Research programmes
Please contact the Doctoral College for further guidance on the development and approval of collaborative research arrangements.
Guidance
Read full details of the planning, development and approval of new collaborative arrangements in the Collaborative provision guidance (PDF).
Taught arrangement types and approval forms
The different categories of collaborative arrangements?permissible within the University's Collaborative Provision framework require completion of different approval forms.? See collaborative provision approval forms?(PDF) which specifies the?different arrangement types for individual approval forms,?which should be completed in accordance with the collaborative provision guidance (PDF) document.? (Please note that Stage 2: Off-Campus Delivery and Advanced Arrangement Form will be circulated to proposers once the Stage 1: Outline Approval Form is fully completed.)
University Register of Collaborative Provision
The University maintains an internal record of partnerships taught in collaboration. Please contact the Quality Assurance Team or International Office for details.
"
Collaborative provision amendments,"The process for making changes to collaborative arrangements will vary according to the category of the arrangement and the type of amendment proposed.
Decisions to make minor amendments to collaborative arrangements which do not change the nature of the collaboration can be approved via the School Taught Student Education Committee and actioned at any time during the term of the legal agreement. The proposal form to amend existing collaborative arrangements will need to be completed.?Examples of minor amendments to a collaborative arrangement would be similar to those employed for non-collaborative provision, and would in most cases not be specific to the arrangement and therefore approved under normal STSEC procedures (for example, module withdrawals).
Small scholarship adjustments, entry requirements and expected student numbers also constitute minor amendments, but should also be done in consultation with the International Office. Potential impacts in terms of recruitment and resources should be considered. Changes to the contract will be drafted and shared with the partner by the International Office.
Changes to an agreement which represent a new proposal (eg adding another programme) should go through the full collaborative programme approval process.
Where schools wish to extend a collaboration with an existing partner to include an additional agreement of a new type (eg the existing arrangement is an articulation but both parties wish to develop a joint degree), the proposal for the new model of collaboration would need to go through the full approval process for the relevant model.
Where the proposal is to extend the existing model of collaboration (eg an articulation) to include another school or faculty at Leeds, the proposal would need to go through the full collaborative programme approval process for the school/faculty joining the agreement.
Where partner universities operate across multiple campuses, there may be a wish to extend the agreement to include students from different locations studying the same programme. This does not represent a new agreement and is treated as an extension to the existing arrangement by adding new progression routes. This can be approved via STSEC as a minor amendment. Changes to the contract will be drafted and shared with the partner by the International Office.???
"
Collaborative provision review,"A collaborative provision arrangement is subject to a full review process within 6 months of its contract expiry date.
All arrangements that formally constitute collaborative provision are subject to a periodic review process. The Review is the principal means by which the University is assured of the efficacy and robustness of the collaborative arrangement in relation to the quality of its learning opportunities and academic standards. It is also the mechanism by which the renewal of the legal agreement governing the arrangement is approved.
The External Collaborative Review document provides further guidance on the review process off-campus, joint delivery and advanced collaborative arrangements. It does not cover arrangements that are characterised as low risk (progression arrangements) which do not formally constitute collaborative provision, as it is expected that these will be monitored via the school/faculty's existing rolling review processes (internal programme reviews and Annual School Reviews).
"
Collaborative provision withdrawal,"The withdrawal of a collaborative arrangement follows a different process to internal provision and varies depending on the category of arrangement.
The withdrawal of a collaborative arrangement carries greater significance compared to standard provision owing to its legal governance. To ensure that all relevant parties are consulted and that the withdrawal process accords with the legal agreement and, where relevant, the student protection plan submitted to the Office for Students, schools must complete a collaborative arrangement withdrawal form.
In the case of off-campus, joint delivery and advanced arrangements (see types of collaborative arrangements (PDF)), the standard programme withdrawal form and a withdrawal action plan (appended to the collaborative arrangement withdrawal form) should also be completed.?
It should be noted that in all cases, termination of the legal agreement ¨C and, by definition, the arrangement itself ¨C is only official when a formal withdrawal letter is sent to the partner. This letter must be drafted by the University Legal Team in consultation with the Quality Assurance Team and the International Office (for international partnerships).??
WITHDRAWAL OF PROGRESSION (ENTRY AND ARTICULATION) ARRANGEMENTS
Schools/faculties must complete the template collaborative arrangement withdrawal form. The withdrawal will need to be approved by the School Taught Student Education Committee and reported to the Collaborations and Partnerships Committee. Following STSEC approval, the school/faculty will liaise with the Quality Assurance Team and International Office (in the case of an international partnership) in preparing the official withdrawal letter.?
WITHDRAWAL OF OFF-CAMPUS, JOINT DELIVERY AND ADVANCED ARRANGEMENTS
Schools/faculties must complete: (1) the standard programme withdrawal form; (2) the template collaborative arrangement withdrawal form, and (3) the withdrawal action plan. The withdrawal will be approved by the School Taught Student Education Committee and the Collaborative Programme Approval Group (the programme withdrawal form should also be sent to the Faculty Programme Approval Group). Once approved, the school/faculty should liaise with the Quality Assurance Team and International Office (in the case of an international partnership) in preparing the official withdrawal letter. The withdrawal will be reported to the Collaborations and Partnerships Committee.
ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR COLLABORATIVE WITHDRAWAL
Schools/faculties should be aware that the termination of all collaborative arrangements is subject to a notice period, the exact duration of which will be specified in the legal agreement.
It is expected that the school/faculty, either directly or via the International Office, will engage with the partner promptly and regularly throughout the withdrawal process to ensure there is a mutual understanding of the responsibilities each side must meet and to manage reputational impact.
Obligations and responsibilities to the students (current or expectant) entering the University through the partnership agreement must continue to be met until the last remaining student(s) have completed the programme. Schools/faculties should therefore be aware that the exit timeframe for a collaborative arrangement may be longer than for international provision.?
"
Teaching Enhancement Scheme overview,"The Teaching Enhancement Scheme is a developmental process centred around continual improvement. It is designed to be simple, flexible and supportive, and replaces the Peer Review of Teaching process.
?
Aims
We believe that all teachers have the capacity to enhance their teaching.
We want:

the Scheme to promote self-reflection, and staff experience of it to be collaborative and mutually beneficial
participation to be a normal expectation for all schools, faculties and services involved in teaching, and for all teaching staff.

Read the Teaching Enhancement Scheme policy?and see the TES process diagram.
Scope
TES encompasses all aspects of student education, such as curriculum design, assessment and blended learning, as well as teaching practice.
It should develop, not add to, existing school enhancement activities (eg learning and teaching away-days, lunchtime discussion/seminar series, working groups on assessment practices, criteria).
Review and improvement of each activity under TES normally lasts between one and two years.
Coordinating and reporting requirements
TES activities need to be agreed and coordinated. Ultimate responsibility for the quality of learning and teaching lies with the Head of School, who normally delegates coordination of TES to a nominated individual.
There are reporting requirements for everyone taking part if TES:

The Head of School should have a system of recording staff participation of in TES. This should be a ""light touch"" approach for monitoring purposes, separate from management and performance processes.
All teaching staff should engage with the TES process on an ongoing basis. Staff are encouraged to share and disseminate positive and negative ideas, outcomes and recommendations through a report. Staff? confidentiality is important - more on Putting TES into action.
TES groups should feed back any agreed outcomes to their school on an annual basis, where appropriate.
Schools should feed back their experiences and good practice of TES through the annual review cycle with the faculty and University.




?
"
Putting the Teaching Enhancement Scheme into action,"There's a lot of freedom under the Teaching Enhancement Scheme to decide what you review and how, but consider confidentiality before you start.
Read about the background to the Scheme in Teaching Enhancement Scheme (TES) overview.
School or service approach
Schools and services need to meet the minimum expectations set out in the TES policy, but the flexibility of the Scheme allows them to determine their own approach. They may, for example, want to:

choose an annual theme or topic for staff as a focus for their TES activities
propose the format of groupings (eg pairs, small groups, module teams)
discuss the perceived conflicts between a formative, mutually beneficial reflective process and the need for confidentiality in instances of perceived risk to staff or students
discuss staff development needs to ensure TES is implemented effectively and staff have confidence in the process. 

How to review
TES activities can be reviewed in different ways, for instance 
by individuals, pairs, cross-school groupings or programme teams. They can be in response to: 
  

individual interests, eg use of social media in teaching
an individual's own perceived development needs, eg via Staff Review and Development Scheme
module or programme team initiatives 
action plans and priorities, eg to respond to National Student Survey
school strategies, eg curriculum review, blended learning.

 
  They can provide an opportunity for junior colleagues to lead on local developments, eg as part of ULTRA (University of Leeds Teaching and Research Award).
What to review 
  
Schools and staff choose what they review. Examples of areas for reflection could include: 

Assessment strategy
Accessibility of the curriculum
Meetings with tutees
Curriculum development
Strategic plans
Action plans
Fieldwork learning
Module review
Practical teaching
Teaching and learning materials development
Feedback approaches
Use of technology to enhance teaching and learning
Online discussions
Teaching delivery
Distance learning

Check if the area you are reviewing has specific University policies or guidance in the A-Z of policies and key documents.
Teaching observation
Review schemes have traditionally focused on one-to-one lecture 
observation, but research shows this often fails to enhance teaching 
practice.
Under TES, you can still use teaching observation, where 
appropriate, but consider lectures, tutorials, seminars and practical 
classes, as well as support materials the teacher provides. 
Staff can ask to have aspects of their teaching observed and expect
 the supportive input of colleagues, or they can ask to observe a 
colleague. Observing colleagues identified as excellent teachers can be a
 great way for staff to absorb new techniques and approaches.
Confidentiality 
  
Confidentiality is an important area to think about before you begin any TES activity. Key points are: 

Schools and services need evidence that TES has been completed (recorded on the TES form), but the details remain confidential to the peer pair or group.
Confidentiality needs to be discussed, and parameters agreed, between the participants before beginning any formal review activity.
Staff may choose to include sections of records or transcripts in their teaching record and to publicise outcomes from their work for the benefit of others.

Skills training
Many of the skills you need to undertake or facilitate TES are those you¡¯d need in any teaching and learning support role. Check what training is available locally or through Staff and Departmental Development Unit if you feel you need support in areas such as: undertaking reflective practice, giving and receiving feedback, confidentiality issues, or responsibilities under duty of care and associated legislation and regulation. 
Areas of concern
Duty of care
If the TES process uncovers practices that go against legislation or the duty of care to prevent foreseeable harm to colleagues and/or students, follow the relevant University guidance as found in the?A-Z of policies and key documents.
Teaching quality
TES aims to establish a collegiate and developmental environment, where colleagues can discuss teaching effectiveness openly and supportively. It does not involve staff reporting issues to managers.?"
TES case studies,"Example situations that could form the basis of a Teaching Enhancement Scheme (TES) cycle.
 
1. Module assessment issue
 
The majority of students did not perform well on a particular module assessment (relative to other assessments at the same level) and claim the teaching and assessment do not connect well.
Over a year, a group of colleagues spend time looking at how the module information and the teaching input (lectures and seminars) work toward achieving the assessment objectives. This involves: 

considering the learning outcomes of the module
analysing the information provided to students - module handbook, assessment criteria and VLE resources
discussing the module with the students
discussing seminar input and links between lectures and seminars with the lecturers who provide the lectures and set the assessment and the tutors who provide the seminars
observing two lectures and two seminars each to see if the input is coherent
analysing the assessment format - questions, instructions and assessment conditions.

2. Practical teaching
 
There is a difference in the way in which groups of students perform during a series of practical sessions. All students say they enjoy the sessions, but the quality of their written work varies considerably in accuracy and content.
A group of colleagues look at the practical teaching and associated information by:

considering the practical handbook and information provided to students before and during the practicals
discussing the experience of the practicals with students
talking to post-graduate demonstrators about the practicals and their approach to demonstrating
observing some practical sessions by visiting the labs at different times
analysing the results by student benches, associated demonstrator and primary subject studied.

3. Module taught by a single member of staff
A member of staff has received very good feedback on her taught masters module, which is focused around an interdisciplinary research area she has recently begun to investigate. Her research is requiring her to work with individuals from other disciplines and from the community and she is aware that her students, only being taught by herself, are perhaps not really being exposed to the true interdisciplinary nature of the subject.
The member of staff contacts a colleague from another discipline whose research and teaching intersects with her own in the hope of finding a way of exposing her students more realistically to the interdisciplinary nature of the subject they are studying. This involves:

discussing each others' research and teaching and identifying common linkages
identifying key points in the curriculum where it would be useful to teach each others' students and bring the students together to discuss issues
inviting a guest speaker from outside the University, who would be able to discuss how the subject impacts the community
undertaking short student focus groups at the end of the module to explicitly discuss their views on the new format
monitoring student learning and assessment scripts for evidence of more informed interdisciplinary thinking.

4. Consistency of project marking
Concern that there are different expectations amongst colleagues who are marking third-year projects.
Colleagues involved in marking third-year projects engage in a blind marking exercise and a follow-up discussion of standards and criteria. This involves:

gathering a set of ten past third-year projects
each colleague is sent two projects every two weeks, over a ten-week period, and is asked to mark them using a simplified proforma and to note brief comments on their thinking
all the marks for each project are collated to show how all colleagues have ranked them overall
colleagues meet to discuss the exercise, the standards they share and to examine the criteria for the projects and if they reflect the criteria colleagues actually use and value.

5. Essay feedback
Colleagues are worried that the feedback practice of using detailed written feedback forms for first-year essays is not resulting in any noticeable improvement in performance.
Colleagues decide to investigate the problem with a view to possibly reducing time spent on written feedback and increasing face-to-face feedback sessions. This involves:

discussing the written feedback format with student focus groups
arranging a session for staff on providing feedback on first-year essays, including examples of written feedback and discussion of providing face-to-face feedback
trialling face-to-face feedback sessions in one module
observing each other providing face-to-face feedback
exploring the use of feed-forward systems, where students comment on how they have used previous feedback in new assessments
evaluating the trial through reflection, student evaluation and an evaluation of student performance.

6. Student progress through a programme
Colleagues are concerned about student progress through a series of core and related modules. Significant discrepancies have arisen in the assessment results between modules and students have expressed dissatisfaction about the ""jump"" in difficulty between the third-year and pre-requisite second- and first-year modules.
Colleagues involved in the delivery of all modules in the programme decide to analyse what is delivered where, and the prior learning and understanding that this assumes, to try and ensure there is coherent development through the module path. This involves:

discussing as a group the essential content that needs to be developed through the module pathways, and the learning outcomes of the programme
analysing how this content is covered at each stage of the module path and whether this coverage is appropriate in terms of how it is delivered, whether it is delivered at the right level to allow progression to the next stage and whether students are made explicitly aware of the core concepts they need for future modules
organising observations by staff between modules to get a sense of how content in dependent modules is delivered
analysing as a group all the evaluation results across all stages to identify whether the issues previously identified continue to occur.

7. End of module student feedback issue
A member of staff has become dissatisfied with the quality of feedback provided in their end-of-module student evaluation questionnaires and is finding it difficult to determine whether the comments made are representative of the group as a whole or just the individual making it.
The member of staff works with two other colleagues to explore ways of gaining more meaningful and representative feedback from students across level 1 core modules. This involves:

discussing with students the importance of good quality feedback to enable staff to improve the student learning experience
providing guidance to students on how to phrase their feedback in a way that is useful and constructive for members of staff
trialling a system of student-formulated evaluation whereby each student on a module constructs an evaluative comment about it, to which all other students respond using a 1-5 ""strongly agree"" to ""strongly disagree"" Likert scale
analysing the results of the trial in terms of the quality of feedback received in comparison to standard end-of-module evaluation questionnaires
feeding back to the students the results of the trial and any actions that will be taken as a response.

8. Building on excellent teaching
A member of staff was recently nominated by students for a national teaching award. The students particularly highlighted his lecturing, which they said was always engaging, interesting and covered complex concepts in an accessible way, despite there being over two hundred students in the lecture theatre. Not all the large group modules in the department are as well received.
To try and achieve greater consistency in large first-year modules, the department has decided to explore the member of staff's approach, why it is successful and whether colleagues in the department may be able to adapt elements of it for their own teaching. This involves:

first-year module leads discussing with the teaching award nominee the purpose and process of giving a lecture 
undertaking observations both of lectures and of lecture materials and handouts to further inform discussions on how the lecturing approach might be developed
trialling methods of ""chunking"" lectures, simple student interaction and interactive handouts and use of clicker technology and podcasts
undertaking a second round of observations to evaluate the successful implementation of these methods
analysing the module feedback to identify any immediate impact.

9. Wider use of blended learning technologies
A module leader is keen to determine whether student engagement and performance can be improved by incorporating new approaches to teaching and feedback.
To explore this they consult a colleague who has broad experience of a range of blended learning approaches. The process involves:

an initial module team meeting at which the colleague provides an overview of some approaches, including use of interactive response systems in teaching sessions, videos to support teaching activities, online assessments, podcasts of lectures and video feedback on assessments
deciding on the use of interactive systems in teaching sessions and podcasting of lectures
the module team considering what they were trying to achieve in terms of learning outcomes and discussing how to collect student information to judge the effectiveness of the new approach(es), for example modifying end of module/programme feedback forms
analysing as a group all the evaluation and performance results and student comments to identify whether there was any evidence that there has been an impact
agreeing how to proceed with any revisions to elements of the module in future.

10. School-based staff engagement
A Director of Student Education is concerned that staff in their school do not have an overview of the profile and content of programmes, that there is no obvious mechanism for sharing good practice, and that new initiatives are not appropriately discussed or widely consulted on.
Following discussion with the Head of School they decide to explore various schemes with staff to identify those likely to create the greatest staff engagement. This includes:

a slot at each monthly staff meeting to inform, consult on and discuss a specific issue or set of related issues, or to present cases of good practice
a bi-monthly meeting of staff who teach to discuss and share experiences on teaching-related matters, including reviewing programme content, assessment and teaching approaches
a lunchtime seminar series to focus on teaching- and learning-related matters with both internal (faculty) and external (University or outside) speakers
making use of the annual school away day to consider strategic developments, course changes, new modules, examples of good practice, assessment approaches, feedback and feed-forward, and new technologies
an annual provision of teaching enhancement project funds (¡ê1,000-5,000)
introducing annual prizes for good teaching practice within the school.

11. Enhancing employability opportunities in a programme of study
A member of staff has become concerned about the balance of skills and opportunities for professional development available at both programme and module level, which might negatively impact student employability and might have contributed to the recent fall in the Destination of Leavers in Higher Education (DLHE) statistics for their programme.
The member of staff initiates a TES cycle with the programme team to consider where the programme includes elements or assessments that enhance student employability or professional development and to consider further developments. This involves:

Module evaluations,"Module Evaluations - Explorance Blue?
Module evaluation is the processes of collecting feedback from your students on the relevance, effectiveness and efficiency of your modules. This page gives more detail on the University of Leeds approach to module evaluation.?
In September 2021, the University began implementing Explorance Blue as its institutional module evaluation tool to help improve the user experience for both students and staff. ?It provides effective tools for the collection, analysis and reporting of student evaluation, and offers innovations that will help to close the feedback loop with students. Explorance Blue replaces the Enterprise Surveys module evaluation tool, which ceased to be available from July 2021.?
Pilot rounds of module evaluations took place successfully in September and October 2021 using a basic version of the tool and the standard institutional question set. In late November, a large-scale pilot covering the 31 schools that previously made use of Enterprise surveys is taking?place. The project team will support all schools to begin using Explorance Blue by September 2022.?
Module leaders from the 31 schools using Explorance Blue were?contacted by the project team in November 2021 with details of what to expect. Support materials and access to light-touch training will be available for anyone wanting to use the?system in more in-depth ways. ?
If at any point you have questions, comments or concerns, please contact the project team at?TheLeedsPartnership@leeds.ac.uk?for further information.???
What is module evaluation and what questions are used? ?
Module evaluation guidelines and questions are agreed by the Student Voices and Review Group (a subgroup of Quality and Standards Committee), which includes academic staff, the LUU Education Officer, and SES colleagues within its membership. The survey questions used in 2020/21 remain in place. The standard survey consists of:?

10 likert scale questions, scored on a 5-point scale from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree?
2 free text questions asking what the students liked and disliked about the module?
3 School-based questions?

School-based questions can consist of any combination of likert scale and free-text questions. At present these are decided at school level. Unlike Enterprise Surveys, Explorance Blue allows us to embed these questions in the survey. In future, Explorance Blue will allow for more question personalisation options.?
How does Explorance Blue work??
Explorance Blue draws its data from Banner and uses Term Code data to auto-assign a module into the correct tranche of module evaluations. The accuracy of this data is then checked by a Data Integration Gateway Administrator (DIG Admin). DIG Admins are Student Education Service colleagues specially trained for this function. ?
When are modules evaluated and how long do surveys run for??
Module evaluations will normally run?at the end of a module.?They usually remain open?for a full calendar month, with exceptions around the end of Semester 1 and 2.??
Explorance Blue is?a flexible system and if you require the evaluation to run over non-standard dates, this can be accommodated. Please contact TheLeedsPartnership@leeds.ac.uk for further details. ?
Mid-module snapshots:?We are?not?currently?able to offer mid-module snapshots via?Explorance?Blue. If you teach a long, thin module that runs across semesters 1 and 2?and require a mid-module snapshot,?please get in touch with?TheLeedsPartnership@leeds.ac.uk?to find out what your options are.??
I¡¯m a module leader - what happens when my survey goes live??
You will receive an email to say that your survey has gone live, inviting you to review your response rates on Explorance Blue (see ¡®A practical guide to Explorance Blue¡¯). ?
When your survey goes live, it will be automatically distributed to all students enrolled on the module via email. They will also see a pop-up each time they log into Minerva,?prompting?them?to complete?all?open?module evaluations.?They?will no longer see a link to the survey on their Minerva module page. Students will receive up to three reminders to complete the survey. These will automatically cease once they have completed all active Module Evaluations. ??
You will automatically be given access to the results of your module evaluation within one week of the survey closing. (This delay allows us flexibility to deal with exceptional situations).?
Promoting module evaluations to your students?
While students will be automatically prompted to complete surveys,?it is helpful for module leaders to give them time in class to complete the survey, or to otherwise prompt them to do so.?Slides?to support this are available below:?

"
Guidance on Interpreting and Responding to Feedback,"This page gives guidance and examples to help you analyse and respond to student feedback in module evaluations, including support for colleagues who receive no module evaluation feedback, and on feedback for merged modules.?
The effective translation of student feedback into the enhancement of student education can be challenging for several reasons:

Data may be non-representative (particularly where response-rates are low)?
Students may not always effectively evaluate their learning experiences?
Comments can be out of context, difficult to interpret, or unconstructive?
Student feedback may be contradictory
Staff may experience emotional reactions to feedback

The following practices can help to engage with student feedback, and determine how you want to respond to it.
Analysing feedback
Consider how you think the module went: Before you read your module evaluation report, reflect on what you hoped to accomplish in the module, and how the class has met those goals. This can help to put student comments in perspective.
Group comments thematically: For ease of interpretation, group your comments by theme, or organise them into strengths and weaknesses. This will allow you to spot trends and areas that require attention. Some colleagues prefer to read all comments, and then set these aside for a time before returning to them to consider themes.
Identify outliers: Outliers are comments that differ substantially from the rest of the data you have gathered. You should always consider outliers ¨C whether positive or negative ¨C in context, and balance them against other feedback received.?
Contextualise your module evaluations: You will likely have received other feedback ¨C formal or informal ¨C during the semester. Take this into account when reading module evaluations. It is also helpful to consider what other contextual factors have influenced student experience. Ensure that you are working with both the Likert-scale data and free-text comments. Where possible, use the comments to contextualise the numeric data.?
Use CSVs: Explorance Blue allows you to download your data as a CSV, which can be opened in Excel. This lets you see each (anonymised) student¡¯s comments in relation to their Likert-scale question scores. This can be particularly useful in understanding outliers.?
Responding to feedback in the Student Report
Below are some pointers for responding to student feedback, as well as some examples of wording. A step by step guide for using the Explorance Blue Student Report can be found here.
You don¡¯t need to address everything: Even if you identify several themes in the feedback, you should only select a small number of these to address with students rather than attempting to cover everything. The themes you choose may be the most common threads, or perhaps those that you would consider most impactful. You might also use the space to update students on issues already discussed in class.
Example: Thank you to everyone who provided feedback. You raised a variety of points, and the teaching team and I will be considering these carefully over the next few months.?
Two of the key issues that students raised were organisation and access to resources. As discussed in the week 10 lecture, we are aware that students were sometimes confused about where to find course materials. Following school-wide discussion at Student Staff Partnership Forum, it has been agreed that all materials will be stored on XX platform.?
Dealing with differing opinions: It is common for student comments to contain differing, even contradictory opinions on major themes. We advise that you acknowledge this difference in your response ¨C this helps students to understand the complexity of student education and that more than one voice needs to be heard.?
Example: It was clear that students across the module had differing opinions on group work ¨C some of you found this to be your favourite part of the module, while others did not find it to be beneficial. While we consider groupwork to be an essential skill to develop within our industry we recognise that additional support is required where groups are not cohering.?
Articulating changes to students: If you make changes in response to student feedback, it can be helpful to indicate why you think these changes are valuable. You can also use this as an opportunity to reiterate strengths that already exist on the course.
Example: Several students noted that they wanted further exposure to Adobe. I appreciate that students felt time working with this software to be beneficial, and I will be dedicating more seminar time to this next year.
You don¡¯t have to change anything: Not all student feedback can or should be enacted, and students do not necessarily expect that every piece of feedback will be implemented. However, it is important that students are told why certain changes will not be made, or may not be possible or beneficial.?
Example: Some students requested that we move back to the old format of closed book, knowledge-recall examinations. Our move away from this format of exams is in line with the University of Leeds assessment strategy and there is clear research showing our new form of examination is of benefit to students. There is also considerable support available for the new format of examinations. Please see XX and XX.?
Check for shared understanding: Sometimes students feel that something has not contributed to their learning, even if there is other evidence to suggest that your approach is working. It is possible in these cases that students are not understanding the goal of activity. In this context it can be helpful to reiterate this goal and consider how this can be communicated in future.
Example: Some students felt that more time should be dedicated to practical experience in the field. This module, however, was specifically focused on the theoretical underpinnings of our field. A variety of practice-oriented modules are on offer in Year 2.?
Acknowledge if feedback is unrepresentative: If very few students responded to your evaluation, make note of this (even if briefly) and be clear that this affects your ability to understand the broader experience of the course.?
Example: Thank you to all students who completed their module evaluation. Unfortunately, the number of responses was very low and therefore has made it difficult to adequately reflect on the feedback received.
Dealing with negative feedback
This year we have developed guidance for students on how to give effective and constructive feedback. Students are directed to this guidance (available on the For Students module evaluations webpage) when they receive invitations to complete module evaluation. The guidance provided states that feedback should be:

Respectful
Depersonalised
Balanced
Accurate and specific
Constructive

If you are concerned about the feedback that you have received or have found this distressing, please contact the Module Evaluation Team?so?we can offer further support.
Support for colleagues with no module evaluation responses?
A small number of modules have received no module evaluation feedback, making it challenging to answer the first two questions of the Student Report. Below, you can find guidance and suggested wording for dealing with this situation. The guidance below relates to two scenarios: one in which staff have access to student feedback from other sources, and another in which no student feedback is available.?
Using student feedback from other sources:?
Colleagues are welcome to incorporate student feedback from other sources into the Student Report. Such feedback may include:?

Discussions or questions in class?
Non-confidential feedback gathered and delivered by Course or School Representatives?
Feedback received via other module evaluations relating to the same or similar teaching content?

While it is possible to use this feedback to respond to the Student Report, it is recommended that the lack of module evaluation responses is explicitly acknowledged. Possible wording can be found below:?
Question: Provide a brief summary of the key themes arising from the student feedback. (This may include strengths/positive aspects and suggested areas for improvement.)?
Example Answer: Whilst there were no student responses to this module evaluation (please consider responding to the opportunity to feedback in the future ¨C your views are important to us) feedback offered in class/ by Course Reps/ on other versions of the module suggests¡­ ?
If no student feedback is available:?
In an instance where a colleague has received little or no feedback from students, it is recommended that this is acknowledged for the first two questions of the Student Report. Colleagues should then use the questions to reflect on the delivery of the module. Possible wording can be found below:?
Question: Provide a brief summary of the key themes arising from the student feedback. (This may include strengths/positive aspects and suggested areas for improvement.)?
Example Answer: Whilst there were no student responses to this module evaluation (please consider responding to the opportunity to feedback in the future ¨C your views are important to us), I have reflected on the delivery of the module and¡­?
Question: Outline how the themes identified will inform the development of the module and teaching and assessment practice. (You may also wish to refer here to feedback from prior years or received via other mechanisms eg. Course Representatives.)?
Example Answer: As above?
Feedback for merged modules?
Currently on Explorance Blue, modules are disaggregated in the same way as they are on Banner. This means that some module leaders may have received requests to complete two Student Reports across one merged module. In this instance it is suggested that the same report is used for both versions of the module. Text can be copied and pasted into the second response form. We are working to enable the merging of modules in future, preventing this issue.?
Seeking support
Module Evaluations Team: The Module Evaluations Team?can offer signposting to support. If you have feedback on your experience of the Student Report or the Module Evaluation process, you can also share this with them anonymously via this form, or via email.
School and Faculty support: OD&PL¡¯s list of student education support at the University of Leeds identifies academic roles and teams that can help in the development of student education practice.?
Peer support: It can be helpful to discuss with colleagues teaching on the same programme (and beyond) whether they are experiencing similar issues.

"
The Student Report - Closing the Feedback Loop,"The Student Report is the module leaders¡¯ response to module evaluations. This page explains more about the process.?
Module Leaders should complete a light-touch ¡®Student Report¡¯ using Explorance Blue, which replaces the former requirement to complete a module review form.*
The Student Report offers an opportunity to reflect on the performance of the module in the light of student feedback and will be shared with students so they can see how their feedback will inform the development of the module.?
It consists of a short form, to be completed in Explorance Blue, which is automatically disseminated to all students on the module. The system will keep a record of this correspondence, accessible to colleagues who will formerly have seen Module Review forms (eg Directors for Student Education).?
Module leaders currently have 31 days to complete this short report. Subsequently, we will move towards a more responsive approach and timeframe.?
* Some schools will retain the Module Review process this year in order to meet local or external reporting requirements. Schools not using Explorance Blue should continue to communicate with their students following the normal process, and may opt to use an MS Word version (link to follow) of the Student Report if preferred.?
Why is the Student Report being piloted?
This new process is intended to reduce administrative burden on Academic and SES staff, offering a significantly more streamlined process. It allows Module Leaders to report the results of student feedback in a constructive and timely way, helping to ¡®close the feedback loop¡¯.
Feedback from colleagues and students using this new approach is welcomed and can be given by?contacting the Module Evaluations Team or completing the relevant sections of this MS form.
What goes into a Student Report?
Module Leaders are encouraged to reflect on areas of good practice and any opportunities for development, reflecting on the delivery of the module and the comments and suggestions provided by the student feedback. They will be asked to respond to the following prompts in Explorance Blue:

Provide a brief summary of the key themes arising from the student feedback. (This may include strengths/positive aspects and suggested areas for improvement.)
Outline how the themes identified will inform the development of the module and teaching and assessment practice. (You may also wish to refer here to feedback from prior years or received via other mechanisms eg. Course Representatives.)
Provide a brief outline of any further reflections on the delivery of the module and any further opportunities for development to align with learning and teaching principles and curriculum themes.

An example of a Student Report and step-by-step guidance is available here.
Who needs to complete a report?
Module leaders are responsible for completing reports and inputting the responses on to the system, but are welcome to collaborate with colleagues for team-taught modules.?
What is the deadline for my Student Report?
We ask that module leaders complete their reports?within 31 days of receiving their module evaluation results. Reports will then be briefly held in the system and quality checked before being disseminated to students in batches.?
Once the system is better embedded, we will move towards a more responsive approach and timeframe, with Module Leaders offered more flexibility to release reports earlier within a specified timeframe if desired.?
The table below shows the deadlines for modules that fall within our large module evaluation tranches, but this will differ if you have a different module evaluation end-date. Your student report deadline will be displayed in Explorance Blue.

School Action Plans
Action Plans will be discussed at the Annual School Review meetings in November/December, and should be regularly updated and shared at School Taught Student Education Committee meetings. See School Action Planning process.
"
School Action Planning Process,"The School Action Planning process is a holistic approach for the implementation and reporting of all School level actions arising from a wide range of student education review and monitoring activity.
The Action Plan requires identification of key thematic priorities at the start of the year which are discussed and agreed with students. Schools are also required to update their Action Plan in response to relevant student education data and information as this becomes available throughout the session.
Process

The action plan process requires ongoing reflection in response to the release of relevant student education data and information. Consideration of newly released student education metrics, external examiner reports and the process of programme review informs updates for the submission of an updated School Action Plan to the Annual School Review and meetings of the Faculty Taught Student Education Committee.
	?
Schools should identify a small number of key thematic priorities for the academic session based on the latest NSS and Undergraduate Programme Survey (UGPS) results, alongside any other key Student Education priorities. These priorities need to be agreed in collaboration with the School¡¯s students and discussed at an early meeting of Student Staff Partnership Forum. Key thematic priorities identified will be reported to the first meeting of the FTSEC in October and action plans presented for discussion at the Annual School Review meeting to be held in the first Semester.
	?
Schools should update their Action Plan throughout the session and it should be a standing item on the agenda of the School Taught Student Education Committee (STSEC). The Action Plan is a living document to record progress against the identified actions. The Action Plan should be regularly shared with students so that students can see what is happening as a result of their feedback, to help close the feedback loop.

Published School Action Plans
School Action Plans are published anually on the Responding to your Feedback website.
"

External examiners,"External examiners are an essential part of the University's quality assurance processes. The role of the external examiner is to provide assurance to the University that its assessment system is fair and operated equitably, and to ensure comparability of the University's standards with those in peer institutions.
Handbook?
The external examiner handbook provides information on University policies and procedures related to external examining, external examiner appointments and duties, and how the University considers external examiner reports.
??? ?External Examiner Handbook?(PDF)
Appointments
At least one external examiner must be appointed to each taught programme offered by the University.?External examiners are normally appointed for four years. Schools should submit nominations to the Quality Assurance Team using the external examiner nomination form. This should be accompanied by the nominee¡¯s CV and proof of the nominee's eligibility to work as required by United Kingdom Visas and Immigration (UKVI). Nominations must be approved by the Chair of the relevant Faculty Taught Student Education Committee.

Regulatory reporting of data,"Like all universities, Leeds has a variety of regulatory reports that it is obliged to provide to statutory bodies. One of these is the HESA student return, which is due to change significantly from August 2022. This page explains how we are preparing for that change.
HESA is the Higher Education Statistics Agency, the designated data body for higher education in England. It collects a range of data from universities, including data on students, programmes of study, academic outcomes and sources of funding.
At present, universities are required to provide their data once a year, but from August 2022 Data Futures (often abbreviated to DF) will launch a new collection specification. HESA will start collecting data twice a year from 2023. This will help make the process more efficient and standardised across universities, as well as enabling more immediate analysis of the data. HESA is also changing the data it requires, which will include collecting additional items like thesis title, an indicator for students estranged from their families, and module results. ?
Preparing for the change
A Regulatory Reporting project team is working to prepare the University¡¯s systems and processes to be ready for this change. As well as ensuring that all the mandatory data can be collected and returned, the project will be addressing the issue of data quality and putting in place mechanisms to assure this going forward.
It¡¯s crucial that everyone working at the university who deals with data understands that they play a part in the student data lifecycle, which is integral to the HESA return. The student data lifecycle cuts across the functional structure of the University and encompasses multiple teams and processes. Each one of you enters and exits the lifecycle at different points, up- and/or downstream of each other.
This means that data issues at any point in the lifecycle can have a knock-on effect elsewhere and changes to processes are sometimes made at one point in the lifecycle without having been fully discussed with all the affected stakeholders. As well as this affecting operational efficiency, it can have a significant negative impact on data quality.
Data governance
While it may sound like an uninspiring topic to some, data governance activity is a vital aspect of ensuring data is accurate, reliable and meaningful. It helps us define our data so that there is a shared understanding of what it means. Policies tell us who can and can¡¯t access data and what they can and can¡¯t use it for. Governance processes describe the steps we must take when data needs to be redefined, or a change is needed in the data structure, or an issue has arisen that needs fixing.
Done right, these activities, and others, will result in a higher quality, reliable set of data. This means we end up with trusted data that can be seen as an asset, as opposed to unreliable data, which can be a liability if it leads to incorrect data returns or decisions being made on a faulty basis. 
Trustworthy data can also be used to help drive automation of processes, which in turn can free up staff time to focus on more complex and developmental work.
What can you do?
It is important for the project team that they have access to the considerable knowledge and experience of staff from across the institution. Key colleagues have already been identified and will be included in discussions and decision-making as appropriate. Even if you are not directly involved your immediate colleagues may be and they might ask you for your input. The better informed you are, the more effectively you will be able to contribute and so we encourage you to engage with and absorb information about HESA DF when it comes your way.
Further information
You can find out more about HESA Data Futures on the HESA website.

Accreditation of prior learning,"The Accreditation of Prior Learning process?allows for the formal recognition of prior learning.
The recognition of prior learning involves the exercise of professional judgement on the part of academic staff to establish that a substantial element of learning has taken place prior to the candidate's admission to a programme. This recognition, when formally agreed and ratified, will lead to the award of credit and allow the credit value gained to be counted towards the completion of a University programme of study and associated award(s).
The Accreditation of Prior Learning policy, endorsed by the Taught Student Education Board (TSEB) on 3 May 2017, encompasses Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL), Accreditation of Prior Certificated Learning (APCL) and Accreditation of Prior Experiential Learning (APEL), as outlined in the definitions below.
Definitions
Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL)?- previously assessed and certificated learning through an education provider is recognised for academic purposes, in adherence with the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications (FHEQ) (also referred to as Credit Transfer in some contexts).
Accreditation of Prior Certificated Learning (ACPL) - the assignment of credit for learning (such as professional development or employment-based awards) that has already been prescribed and recognised by an organisation deemed appropriate to offer awards but that has not led to the award of credit or that is not positioned within the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications (FHEQ).
Accreditation of Prior Experiential Learning (APEL) - experiential learning outside formal education or training is considered and, where appropriate, is recognised for academic purposes.? 
Guidance and forms
Faculties/schools should provide guidance and support to students who may wish to apply for APL, including information on acceptable evidence, the volume of material required and the proof of authenticity. Guidance for faculties/schools and guidance for applicants?are available on how to process/apply for APL.
Applicants are required to complete the Accreditation of Prior Learning application form?and submit this to the relevant faculty/school with appropriate evidence for consideration.
For undergraduate studies, applicants seeking accreditation of prior learning should apply in the normal way via UCAS. UCAS instruct applicants wishing to be considered for entry other than to level 0 or 1 to first contact the institution. However, as not all applicants do so, care should be taken not to make an offer where the applicant has completed the point of entry as 2 or 3 on the UCAS form before permission is granted by your School Taught Student Education Committee (SLTC) or sub-group thereof.
Upon approval, the?faculty/school is required to complete the correct APL form depending on the level and type of APL.
For undergraduate applicants please retain the original for your department records and provide a scanned copy via email to the Taught Admissions team at ug_enquiry@leeds.ac.uk 
For taught postgraduate applicants, please refer to the Advanced Standing CRM guide in the CRM user guides?section.
Accreditation of Experiential Learning proforma (long form) - for undergraduate APL or postgraduate APEL
Accreditation of Prior Learning proforma (short form) - for postgraduate APL
All accreditation must be reported to your School Taught Student Education Committee (STSEC).
Any accreditation over 60 credits must be approved by the Taught Student Education Board (TSEB).
It is possible to view the APLs in Banner for registered students using the report SWRPRSL.

Attendance code of practice (taught students),"Students are expected to attend all timetabled sessions. The University is clear about its expectations of students and in the information that schools provide to students to enable them to attend regularly.
University code of practice
The sessions organised as part of a programme of study - lectures, group work, laboratory work, tutorials, seminars and practical classes - are a crucial part of enabling students to achieve the maximum benefit from their time at the University.

Attendance at designated online and remote sessions is compulsory irrespective of whether or not a module forms a core, optional or elective part of a programme of study.
Schools will have procedures for students to report absence / monitor engagement?and make clear the procedures for students to apply for leave of absence in exceptional circumstances.
Schools will have a clear process for monitoring?student engagement?and addressing any patterns of non-attendance or low attendance?at an early stage. Where non-attendance is a potential problem a ""warning system"" will be in place for the student. If the problem continues the Unsatisfactory Work, Attendance and Engagement Procedure will be used.
Co-curricular activities and paid employment must normally be fitted around formal timetable commitments. Wednesday afternoons, that is from 1.00pm, will normally be kept free for co-curricular activities. On occasions where a student is involved in a University supported activity, eg competing in a national sporting event or representing the University in a sporting event, which involves leaving a timetabled session before 1.00pm they must notify the tutor in advance in order to discuss how the session commitments might be met in another way. It is the responsibility of the student to find out what work has been missed and to complete any tasks set.
Schools will indicate normal teaching hours making special arrangements to meet the needs of students undertaking religious observance.
Schools will make clear the preparation students are expected to undertake before each timetabled session and whether supporting material is needed for use in class.
Sessions will start promptly at five minutes past the hour and end promptly at five minutes to the hour, unless otherwise agreed with students for a particular session/module.?
Timetabled sessions will only be cancelled in exceptional and unavoidable circumstances, eg staff illness, and alternative arrangements made to minimise disruption for students.?
Staff will all be made aware of the school policy on non-engagement to prevent variability in the treatment of students.
The school policy on?engagement will be considered annually by the Student:Staff committee.
The Dean of Faculty is responsible for ensuring compliance by schools with this code of practice.

Personal tutorials,"
Personal tutorials offered by academic staff in schools are an integral part of the pastoral and academic support for all students on taught programmes.?
Information for students about Support & Wellbeing is available on the ¡®https://students.leeds.ac.uk/#Support-and-wellbeing?
Guidelines for schools, personal tutors and students are incorporated into the personal tutoring policy (PDF) which was updated in February 2014. Each school must have in place arrangements that comply with this policy."
PhD by published work,"
Members of staff have previously been able to apply for the degree of PhD by published work. This arrangement will be withdrawn from session 2014/15.
PhD by published work (PDF) describes the arrangements for staff who have already applied to have their published work considered for the award of a PhD. They must submit for examination by 31 August 2015."
Placement and study abroad - student support,"Students on placements or studying abroad continue to be Leeds students and we continue to provide support to them. Some aspects of support may differ from that provided in Leeds.
The policy on placement and study abroad support (PDF) outlines the expectations of staff and students in relation to periods of study abroad or placements."
Placement leaders handbook ,"The Sub Group for Placement and Internships has developed a guide to support you in your role as a Placement Leader, Placement Year Academic Tutor or Placement Administrator.
The purpose of this guide (DOC) is to provide you with easy access to University-wide documents and guidance which have been developed to support the placement process.?
 "
Postgraduate researchers enrolling on taught modules,"
Postgraduate researchers can participate in taught modules, either with formal?enrolment and assessment, or?by attending part or all of the module without undergoing assessment,in addition to the research if they are useful for training and are approved by their supervisor(s).
STUDYING MODULES WITHOUT ASSESSMENT (AUDITING)
Schools may ask PGRs to attend lectures or seminars which form part of a taught module to gain background knowledge, but may not require them to complete coursework or examination towards assessment of the module. This is called auditing a module.
If this is the case, there is no requirement to return a module enrolment form. It is at the discretion of the parent school to make arrangements for the student to sit in on any lectures and seminars which may be of benefit.?
STUDYING MODULES WITH ASSESSMENT?
Modules are normally taken during the first year of full-time study or the first and second year of part-time study. The ?first commitment is to the research project so the PGR should not undertake too much additional work.
There are different processes if the PGR is on an integrated PhD and masters, normally part of a Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT).
If a PGR wants to take a taught module, a research student module enrolment form should be completed and returned to the Postgraduate Research and Operations team. The form should be authorised by both the parent school and the teaching school offering the module. Fees may be charged where modules are formally assessed.
Read the relevant guidelines (DOC).
"
Pregnant students and students with very young children,"This policy describes the University's approach to supporting students who are pregnant, adopting or have very young children. It provides guidance to students and staff who may advise their students.
 
The?policy on support for pregnant students and students with very young children, provided by the Equality Policy Unit, gives detailed, practical information which will be of particular use to students and those in student facing roles."
Programme title changes (taught students),"Titles of programmes on which students have already been accepted or are currently registered can only be changed if this is unavoidable. A change in programme title affects the validity of student visas for students outside the EEA.
The?Policy on programme title changes (PDF)?was updated in 2010-11 to reflect obligations under the introduction of the Points Based System of immigration control.
 "
Programmes with related titles (taught students),"Where a proposed programme title might be associated with the provision of another school, this consultation process should be followed.
This Consultation between schools on programmes with related titles paper outlines the change to the approval process endorsed by Learning and Teaching Board (now Taught Student Education Board).?"
Proof-reading (taught components),"This policy, intended for the guidance of students and academic staff, relates to the?proof-reading of any text to be submitted as part of academic course work, including dissertations.
The?policy on proof-reading (PDF)?provides definitions of proof-reading in the University of Leeds context, and guidance for students and staff to help avoid contravening the policy. It also explains how inappropriate use of proof-reading could lead to a breach of academic integrity and links to the possible consequences of doing this. The policy relates to course work for any foundation-level qualification, undergraduate, taught?postgraduate, or taught component of a research postgraduate degree."
Referencing policy,"Each?school is?required to select a single referencing style for use by all their taught students.? Schools that have adopted the Harvard or Numeric referencing styles are required to use the standardised Leeds version.?
The?University referencing policy (PDF) sets out referencing requirements for schools.
Centralised support for the standardised Leeds Harvard and Leeds Numeric referencing styles is provided by the Library through webpages, online tutorials, workshops and EndNote styles: see Leeds Library referencing skills. 
 "
Referred students (postgraduate research),"A decision to ""refer"" a thesis normally means that the thesis is potentially of a standard to be awarded a degree but some alterations or improvements need to be made within a specified time period.
Students in this position are issued with the Guide for referred students (PDF).?"
Referred students (taught),"Students can be 'referred' if they have seriously or repeatedly failed examinations. In some instances it is possible for a student to be excluded from the University without previous warning.
The referred students procedure (PDF), held on the Student Cases?webpage, explains the procedure that schools should follow when a board of examiners decides that, because of repeated or serious examination failure, the School no longer wishes to take academic responsibility for a candidate. The procedure details how this decision is to be communicated to the student.
The procedure also outlines the student's right to respond and how any response will be handled by the University.?"

Religious observance,"Our institutional timetable is set to accommodate religious observance where possible. Sometimes issues feel or become more complex at an individual school or service level.
What students need to do?
Students who, for religious reasons, are unable to carry out their university work on a Sabbath or a holy day must advise their school(s) immediately. ?
Where a student's religious commitments prevent them from taking exams on certain days during University assessment periods, they must also?give notice to the Assessment & Progress Team by completing?the?Notification of religious commitments form?by?the last Friday in October for January assessments and by the end of Week 4 of teaching in semester 2 for May/June assessments (see the timeline).
Where exemption is approved, it is the student¡¯s responsibility to ensure they have covered all work from classes that they have missed.
The University will make every effort to avoid arranging assessments on a Sabbath or holy day for those students who have informed the Assessment & Progress Team as required. The University, however, reserves the right to hold assessments?on such days if no alternative time is convenient.?
Further guidance
The Equality Policy Unit provides guidance for staff and students on flexibility on grounds of religion or belief?(PDF) to enable staff to respond in a way which is non-discriminatory. The document offers practical suggestions for handling such requests.

Risk assessment of fieldwork,"Fieldwork is an essential part of University teaching and research, enabling and inspiring many staff and students¡¯ academic and personal development.
Fieldwork includes any activity carried out for the purpose of research outside of the university. This could include archaeological digs, environmental surveys, or interviews. Fieldwork does not include placements but does include meetings and conferences in the UK and abroad.
People organising fieldwork need to use an effective fieldwork assessment process to minimise risk and ensure that as a University we fulfil our duty of care to protect staff, students and other affected people.

Taught postgraduate tuition fee deposits,"Taught postgraduate applicants who need a Student?visa to study in the UK are required to pay the University a tuition fee deposit of ¡ê1500 or provide evidence of full funding.
Applicants who will be taking a summer pre-sessional course at the Language Centre must pay the tuition fee deposit prior to the pre-sessional, and do not need to pay a second deposit for the taught postgraduate course. Those studying a pre-sessional in semester one or two are not required to pay a deposit for either this course or their postgraduate degree.
After an international applicant accepts an unconditional offer, they receive an email asking them to either pay the deposit or provide a final award letter as evidence that they are in receipt of full funding. Financial support from family members does not count as sponsorship, so these applicants will still need to pay a deposit.
Applicants are directed to the portal, where they will need to complete the Deposit and Exemption form to confirm how they will be funding their studies.
If they select that they are self-funding, they will see information about paying the deposit either by an online card payment or through the University¡¯s payment partner, Flywire. Applicants can also make additional payments towards their fees, if they wish. Once the deposit has been paid, the applicant¡¯s right to withdraw and ask for a refund is very limited. Any queries should be directed to the Admissions Enquiries team.
If the applicant selects that they are sponsored, they will need to upload evidence to be checked by the Admissions Enquiries team. Applicants who are internally confirmed as being in receipt of a University-funded scholarship or US federal loan do not need to provide any evidence in order to be made exempt from the deposit.
Once the deposit or sponsorship evidence has been received, along with any other required documents, the Taught Admissions team is then able to issue a CAS (Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies). The earliest that a CAS can be issued is six months before the start date of the course.
The applicant¡¯s right to a deposit refund is limited. Any queries should be directed to the Admissions Enquiries team using the contact details at the bottom of the page.

Change of module,"Students can submit a request to change modules after the module enrolment system closes by using an online form.?
The University allows students to change modules for up to four weeks after teaching starts. However, some schools only allow changes for a shorter period so be careful when advising students about enrolment. Change of module deadlines are from the second week of teaching but vary by school. Some teaching schools require consultation when a student wishes to enrol on or drop one of their modules.?Please refer to this list of school requirements, deadlines and contact details.?
Once online module enrolment has closed - dates are given in the enrolment guide - students will need to access the online change of module form from the For Students website.
Full details of the new process are detailed in the Operational Guidance.
The Change of Module form closes at the end of week 4 of teaching in the relevant semester.
If a student wishes to change modules after the week 4?deadline has passed, the proposed change must have approval from the Head of School before the change will be allowed.? Confirmation of approval must then be forwarded to the Assessment & Progress Team.? Late module changes after week 4 of teaching are subject to a ¡ê50 late fee.
With Head of School approval students can change modules?up until the end of week 8 of teaching.? After week 8 students are not permitted to change modules and are?expected to complete the assessment for any modules they are enrolled on, and are considered to have missed too much teaching to enrol on any new modules that are taught in that semester.?
After week 8 of teaching and?with permission from the school?students can replace modules, either taking a new module in the next semester or the next academic year.? The module they are replacing will remain on the record and the mark achieved will be recorded on the transcript.? The replaced module will be considered the second and final attempt at the module and will be for a capped module mark.? Where a student is permitted to replace a module confirmation of approval must?be sent to the Assessment & Progress Team.?
"
Change of programme ,"Students do not have an automatic entitlement to change programme, but if places are available and the student meets entry criteria they may be permitted to move to a new programme.
A student enquiring about a potential change of programme will be required to complete this Change of Programme Initial Enquiry Form in the first instance. ?The proposed new Parent School will receive an email notification of the enquiry, which they will consider according to local criteria.
If the student is a Tier 4 international student AND the change would result in a change of programme duration, the Tier 4 Team (pbs@leeds.ac.uk) must be consulted before the change is approved.? It is essential that immigration restrictions are checked and that the student receives immigration advice before a change of programme is approved.? If approved, this will then enable students to request their new CAS and make their new Tier 4 application without delay.?
Tier 4 international students who will be undertaking a work placement or study abroad year can apply for their new Tier 4 leave (visa) before or after their work placement/year abroad as long as this is done before their current leave expires. For further information regarding the process, please see our work placements and study abroad visa page.
Once a change of programme request is approved, the proposed new Parent School will ask the student to complete a full Change of Programme Formal Submission Form and will update the student record in Banner on receipt of the completed form.
Full details of the new process are detailed in the Operational Guidance.
For more information about students changing programme, contact your local Programme Support Manager.?

Taught students?
The manual taught student leavers' form?should be completed for taught students taking temporary or permanent leave, please follow the instructions on the form and on the?¡°when a student leaves¡± page and related guidance pages.?
Research students
If a research student leaves the University permanently before completing their studies, they should complete a research student leavers¡¯ form (DOC) and return it to their school with their student ID card.?Information on the process is available from leaving your research due to a change in circumstances on the SES student website.
"
Mitigating circumstances,"Mitigating circumstances are normally exceptional, short term, unforeseen and unpreventable events that have a significantly disruptive effect on the student¡¯s ability to take assessments.? These events are over and above the course of everyday life and normally outside of their control.? The events may affect the student¡¯s ability to complete coursework or other assessments and revise for and attend on-campus assessments.??
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF???
Mitigating Circumstances?is the umbrella term used by the University of Leeds for the process by which students can seek mitigation for the impact on their ability to complete assessments.?
Students may allude to circumstances that have affected their studies?via their?Academic?Personal Tutor or School Student Support Officer, but this is not sufficient to enable these circumstances to be taken into consideration. There is a formal procedure to follow, a deadline to meet and evidence required to support such claims. If one of your students does mention adverse circumstances that appear to have affected their studies, then this should act as a trigger for you to discuss the formal?Mitigating?Circumstances?process with the student.?
As the onus is on the student to make and evidence the claim for mitigation, then part of your role as an?Academic Personal Tutor?or as a member of the?Student Education Service may be to encourage the student to follow the formal process to ensure that any such circumstances are considered by their Parent?school's?Special Circumstances Committee.??However, it would not be your role to pre-empt or pre-judge the outcomes of such a?Committee, but to advise the student regarding the process.?
There are two routes of mitigation available: ¡®Extensions to Coursework Deadlines¡¯?and ¡®Additional Consideration¡¯.?
Please see the?Mitigating Circumstances Guidance 2021-2022?(Word) for full details, including how?students?apply for an?Extension to a Coursework Deadline?or?Additional Consideration.?
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES OR LONG-TERM HEALTH CONDITIONS?
Disabled?students, or?students with?a long-term health condition (12 months or more) that impacts on?their?day-to-day activities, should register with Disability Services who will advise further on support and reasonable adjustments to?their?study and assessment.? Disability includes Specific Learning Difficulties (such as dyslexia and dyspraxia), as well as diagnosed mental health conditions.?
IF THE STUDENT DOES NOT SIT THEIR ASSESSMENTS AND DOES NOT MAKE AN APPLICATION FOR MITIGATION?
The students are expected to contact their schools to let them know what is happening.??If they do not submit an assessment and do not apply for mitigation they may be withdrawn from their studies.?
If the student is unable to contact their school at any stage, it is important that they get in touch with their school again, as soon as possible.?
In extreme cases, where there is evidence to show that there were circumstances beyond the student¡¯s control which prevented them for contacting their school, a retrospective application for mitigating circumstances may be considered.?
WHAT DO STUDENTS NEED TO DO???
All taught undergraduate and postgraduate students wishing?to?apply for?mitigating circumstances, need to complete?a?Mitigating Circumstances form?and provide supporting evidence?to?their Parent School, even if the module affected is taken in a different school.?
See the?student?pages?for more information about mitigating circumstances.??
WHERE CAN STAFF FIND MORE INFORMATION???
Staff should visit the?Mitigating?Circumstances?web page for more information.??
"

Fresh Start Festival 2022,"Help us give students a Fresh Start
This January, the University and LUU are working together to put on a week of activities after exams (Monday 24 January ¨C?Sunday 30 January) for all students, to reengage existing students with everything on offer at Leeds and welcome new starters joining us in January.
While there has been more on campus activity this semester, many students tell us they haven¡¯t quite found their place or their people yet, and many aren¡¯t aware of all the support, opportunities and activities available to them. Many want to make more connections with others in their own academic discipline ¨C both students and staff. We also have new starters who are either starting their studies in January or who haven¡¯t been able to join us yet due to travel restrictions.
We want to create a week that brings the whole Leeds community together, giving people the chance to meet, socialise, share food, learn new things and enjoy everything campus has to offer. This isn¡¯t freshers¡¯ week, though it will have some similar themes. We want it to appeal to all kinds of students, whatever their background and interest, and to start to rebuild some of the shared community spirit that¡¯s been lost due to Covid.
We¡¯re calling this the Fresh Start Festival and we need your help to bring it to life.
How can staff get involved with the Festival?
You can do as much or as little as you like to support the Festival, from putting on a networking event in your school to simply sharing what¡¯s coming up in your regular communications with students, or sharing our promotional slide at the start of a teaching session to encourage them to see what¡¯s on.
Connection seems to be a key priority for students so you might want to think about:

Organising networking opportunities for students to meet and spend time with their peers and staff
Hosting informal meet ups to help students make connections, like drops-ins and coffee mornings
Putting on Ted- Talk style events to encourage students to explore their area of study further

If you would like to get involved and set up a stall, talk or event, contact project manager Kate Bennett to share your plans. There is funding available so don¡¯t be put off if budget is an issue.
We appreciate how much you¡¯re already doing to help our students feel at home in Leeds and hope you can support us with this initiative, in whatever way you¡¯re able.

Faculty teams,"Faculty teams are a key part of the Student Education Service and work in close partnership with academic colleagues.
Faculty teams are responsible for providing services to students and academic colleagues within their faculty. Depending on the faculty, they may operate as a single co-located team or may be located in individual schools.
 
Within the teams there are some key leadership roles.?
Faculty Education Service Managers (FESMs)
Each faculty team is led by a Faculty Education Service Manager (FESM).? FESMs lead and manage the provision of services to students and academic colleagues within their faculty, as well as shaping and influencing University-wide strategies.

 In each faculty there are also (generally):
School Education Service Managers (SESMs)
These members of staff are based in academic schools and manage staff supporting learning and teaching activities in their school.
Education Service Functional Managers 
The Service is based around five functional areas: admissions, assessment, programme support, quality assurance, student support. Each of these has a functional manager in each faculty.
These members of staff work together to share good practice within their faculty and more broadly across the institution through the CIFMTs. They are tasked with improving the consistency of the experience provided to students and the service delivered to staff. Some faculties have a small number of additional functional managers to cater for their specific needs."

consistency of processes and support for staff and students 
an equitable experience for students 
opportunities for staff. 

Commitment from everyone
A programme of training and development opportunities is available for SES staff. To make the most of these opportunities, the following commitments are needed from the Service, line managers and individual team members:

The Service will provide a comprehensive, high quality and accessible programme of training and development to make sure staff have the knowledge, skills and capabilities to achieve the Service vision and the opportunity to develop their individual potential. 
Line managers (and advisers for those on probation) will ensure staff receive all essential training and have access to further training and development opportunities. Training needs will be reviewed and prioritised through the University Staff Review and Development Scheme (SRDS) process. 
Individual members of SES staff will undertake all essential training and keep themselves informed about developments in their areas of work. They will reflect on their personal training and development needs and contribute to the learning and development of the Service as a whole by sharing their learning experiences and contributing to the review and enhancement of training and development, where possible. 

Although training and development activities don¡¯t guarantee progression, the Service will encourage this and make it happen wherever possible."

What to do with this information?
Analytics tell the story of what your users do when they're on your web pages. It's important to consider how we can use them to improve their experience. The following questions are worth considering when you look at the report:
 

How long are users spending on specific pages? Is it long enough, or do you think it's too long? This is a good indication of whether the information on the page is useful.
Compared with last year, how is the section performing? More or less views? Is the content up to date? Does it need delivering in a different way - is the website the correct place for this content??
If you've been working with Student Communications to plan a social media campaign, can you see the impact of this? What happens when a social media post is made?
Are there any surprises? A lot of traffic could suggest something we're not aware of. Are users having difficulty finding information?

Glossary
Page views
To total number of times a page has been viewed by all users.
Users
Number of users who have had at least one unique session in the specified date range.
Sessions
A session is the period of time a user has actively engaged with your website. For example, when a user goes to a website, reads information, downloads a form then leaves, that would be determined as one session. If they were to come back to the website another time, this would be counted as a different session.
Entrances
Volume or percentage of the number of times users entered the website through a specific page or group of pages.?For example, if a page had 2,000 page views and 500 entrances, this would mean 500 people arrived on the website at that page, and 1,500 viewed one or more other pages on the website before viewing that page.
Bounce Rate
The percentage of sessions which only include one page and registered no interaction with the content.
Exit %
This indicates what percentage of users left the website after viewing this page.
Default Channel Grouping
A group of sources with the same medium. Example: Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are all social media so in channels they will be group together under ¡®Social¡¯, much like how Google, Bing and all other search engines are grouped together as ¡®Organic Search¡¯.
Channel: ¡®Referral¡¯
Indicates when users clicked a link from another site, excluding major search engines. This could include some University of Leeds website which are not using the central Google Analytics tracking code.
Traffic Source
Every visit to a website has an origin point, known as a ¡®source¡¯. This might be in the form of a search engine or a referral from another website. The ¡®Traffic Source¡¯ report tells us the specific URL¡¯s which are directing traffic to our website.
Source: ¡®Direct¡¯
Direct traffic is usually a result of when a user enters the URL into their browser, or arrives via a previously saved bookmark.?

Updating pages?
We have a governance structure which means that every page on both the SES and For Students website has a named owner. Owners are responsible for making sure that content on their pages is up to date and accurate.
The owner may not always make changes to the information on the website. There are a number of authors who can create and amend content but it always has to be approved by someone else before it goes live on the website. This makes it easier to check that new content is written in the same style as the rest of the site and that it has been put in the best place(s) on the site.
Please contact studentcommunications@leeds.ac.uk?if you'd like more information."
Service Culture Statement,"The Service¡¯s Culture Statement has been developed in collaboration with colleagues across the SES; it describes what we believe is important both in terms of our service delivery and being part of the SES community.
The Student Education Service consists of over 800 colleagues working together across a large campus; having a collective view of how we would like our service culture and community to be across all parts of the Service was felt to be an important development.
Download the Service Culture Statement?
How it was developed
During 2018 roadshows were held in a variety of locations across campus in order to include everyone in the SES. The aim of these events was to discover what people thought should be included within the Culture Statement both in terms of the service we provide and the community we want to be part of.
Over 200 colleagues attended the roadshows to input their views and share ideas. Using the feedback provided, a small working group consisting of representatives across the Service, drafted the first version of the Culture Statement. Opportunity was then given to all Service staff to comment on the draft, and further refinements were made.
The SES Culture Statement was created by the SES community to describe how they would like the culture to be within the Service. It is the responsibility of all colleagues to help bring this to life and so we would encourage teams to reflect on the values and behaviours included within the Statement. The Statement will be reviewed every two years to ensure it accurately reflects the values and behaviours colleagues feel are important within the service.
 
 "
SES Principles for Ways of Working,"The SES Principles for Ways of Working were created?collaboratively?by the SES community?to guide decisions?about how we work and deliver our service in a post-COVID?era.?
The principles?are not a set of rules, but?emphasise?our Service?values?and what we collectively believe?is?important to?inform?our decision-making.?They are intended to be used by all colleagues across the Service.?The principles will be reviewed?regularly?to ensure they?remain?aligned?with?our culture statement?and?University/Service?values.??
Five Principles for Ways of Working
1. We are?all?committed to providing an excellent service for our stakeholders?and supporting each other within our SES community??
Our 'service excellence' is our top priority and will be the starting point for all of our choices about ways of working in our team and how we deliver our?element of the Student Education Service.?The importance of colleague wellbeing is recognised and we will all strive to?ensure the best outcomes for individuals?where possible.???
2. Our hybrid working model will be appropriate for the?activity?
Working?remotely?may?not suit every task, but equally, not every activity needs to be?undertaken on campus. Decisions about where,?how,?and when?tasks are undertaken?will?consider?the needs of colleagues and stakeholders as the recipients of a consistent and effective service.?
3. Our ways of working will be?planned, adaptable and responsive?
We are always looking to innovate or improve how our services are delivered.?Decisions?about ways of working will be?reviewed regularly?by?teams?and we will be willing to adapt to deliver our service.?We are clear on our objectives and expectations, and we carefully consider how our ways of working impact our outputs and relationships.?
4. We value collaboration and community?
We work as one team with shared goals and shared values as part of one University.?We maintain our focus on service delivery, sustaining?relationships, and?enabling?collaboration, whilst appreciating and recognising individual preferences?and circumstances.?We trust teams to agree the best way of?working to enable collaboration?and deliver service excellence.???
5. Decisions relating to ways of working will be transparent and equitable?
Decisions about how, when,?and where individuals and teams?work will be made in line with these principles.?
